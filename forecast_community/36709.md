(a) **Time Left Until Resolution:**  
There are approximately 3.5 months remaining until September 1, 2025, the resolution date for whether DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for an Ivy League university.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
As of May 13, 2025, no Ivy League university, including Harvard, has had its SEVP certification formally revoked or suspended. Harvard faced an explicit threat and was given an April 30 deadline to comply with DHS demands for detailed records. The university has stated it responded to DHS, providing information “required by law,” though specifics remain unclear. No credible source yet reports that SEVP certification has been revoked or suspended for any Ivy League school[2][3][4][5].

(c) **No Outcome Scenario:**  
DHS receives a response from Harvard (and by extension, other Ivy League universities are not under similar threat) that is deemed sufficient for compliance with legal requirements, or a compromise is reached. Despite political rhetoric, SEVP certification remains in effect for all Ivy League institutions. Even if DHS is dissatisfied, legal challenges, bureaucratic delays, or lack of precedent for such a drastic step prevent any actual revocation or suspension before September 1, 2025.

(d) **Yes Outcome Scenario:**  
DHS determines Harvard’s response is inadequate or non-compliant, or seeks to make an example for political reasons, and formally notifies Harvard (or another Ivy League institution) that SEVP certification is revoked or suspended, effective immediately. This action would prevent the university from enrolling new international students under F and M visas, with current students forced to transfer, change status, or leave the U.S. This could happen even if a court blocks the move, as the question resolves Yes if the revocation is enacted in defiance of a court order.

## Rationale

The **status quo** strongly favors a No resolution: Historically, revocation of SEVP certification from highly prestigious, well-resourced institutions such as those in the Ivy League is nearly unprecedented. Even amidst significant political and public pressure, the U.S. government tends to move cautiously on actions that would upend the education sector, create massive international controversy, and affect thousands of students and their home countries[2][5].

Harvard has stated it has complied with legal requirements and provided the requested information to DHS[5]. While the DHS demand was unusually aggressive and politically charged, compliance—at least with information that is legally disclosable—greatly reduces the immediate risk of summary decertification. There is also strong legal protection for education institutions and ongoing lawsuits regarding similar DHS actions, which further raise the barriers to a rapid or unilateral decertification[2][3][4][5].

Nevertheless, **risk is elevated above baseline**:  
- The Trump administration has shown a willingness to take unprecedented actions in the immigration and education space.
- The threat was explicit, time-bound, and accompanied by real punitive measures (grant cancellations, public pressure).
- DHS could plausibly move forward with decertification if, in its view, Harvard’s response was insufficient—even if this is followed by injunctions or legal battles.

**However, the fact that no formal revocation has been announced in the nearly two weeks since the April 30 deadline suggests that:**
- Harvard’s response may have satisfied at least the minimum requirements for continued certification, or
- Bureaucratic/legal review is ongoing, and the extreme reputational/economic consequences of decertifying Harvard (or any Ivy) may be causing internal hesitancy.

**Absent new developments, the default is inertia:**  
Major institutional change involving elite universities and massive regulatory implications rarely proceeds quickly without overwhelming evidence and a very high-level commitment to following through, which could attract significant public, legal, and international backlash.

## Final Probability Estimate

Given the above, I assess a moderate likelihood that the situation escalates to a formal, effective revocation or suspension, but the balance of probabilities still favors the status quo (no revocation) given Harvard's stated compliance and the lack of immediate action post-deadline.

**Probability: 35%** (that DHS will revoke or suspend SEVP certification for an Ivy League university before September 1, 2025)
