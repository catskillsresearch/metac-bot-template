(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
Approximately 6 weeks remain until July 1, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
No new law has been enacted that fully prohibits the sale of THC in Texas statewide. If the legislature does not pass and the governor does not sign such a law before July 1, the answer resolves as **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The Texas Legislature finishes its session without passing a new law that fully bans all THC sales. Alternatively, any legislation enacted imposes partial restrictions (e.g., on vaping, on synthetics, or on sales to minors), expands medical access, or increases regulation rather than enacting a comprehensive statewide ban. This matches the current status quo, as recent House actions amended proposed bans to allow continued sale of certain THC products and focus on expanded medical use instead[1][2][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A last-minute legislative breakthrough occurs, with lawmakers reconciling differences in conference, reverting to the original full ban language of SB 3 (or similar bill), and passing it through both houses. The governor signs the bill into law before July 1, 2025. This would require significant and rapid political alignment given current divisions, the short remaining timeline, and stakeholder opposition[1][3][4][5].

## Rationale

The Texas Senate and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pushed hard for a full THC ban in the 2025 session, and SB 3 initially sought to outlaw all THC sales outside the medical program[4][5]. However, the Texas House substantially amended the bill to only ban vapes, synthetic cannabinoids, and certain forms of THC products—while explicitly allowing continued sale of some low-THC items, such as THC-infused beverages and certain edibles not marketed to children[1][3]. Counties would even be allowed to opt out locally, rather than a blanket statewide ban[1][3].

Additionally, the Texas House recently passed bills expanding access to medical cannabis, not restricting it[2]. There is strong political and business pushback against a full ban, and the late-session amendments indicate a legislative compromise that falls far short of the comprehensive prohibition required by this question[1][3]. No other pending legislation seeks a total ban.

While Lt. Gov. Patrick has threatened to call a special session if a full ban is not passed, the historical pattern in Texas strongly favors legislative inertia, especially given divided interests and the complexity of such a late-stage reversal[5]. Most observers and analysts expect tighter regulation and targeted restrictions, not an outright ban[1][3][5].

## Final Assessment

Given the latest legislative developments, political dynamics, and time remaining, it is highly improbable Texas will enact a law fully prohibiting the sale of all THC before July 1, 2025. If current trends persist—and barring dramatic, last-minute parliamentary maneuvers—the answer will almost certainly be **No**.

**Probability: 5%**
