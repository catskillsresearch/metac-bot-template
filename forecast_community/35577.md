(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
IMF's World Economic Outlook database for 2025 will be used for resolution, with data expected by October 2025 and the final outcome determined as of January 7, 2026. This leaves roughly 8 months from today (May 9, 2025) until the official answer is known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
According to the IMF's latest projections, India's nominal GDP for 2025 is expected to be $4,187.017 billion, while Japan's GDP is projected at $4,186.431 billion[1][2][5]. This is an extremely narrow lead—less than $1 billion—which means the status quo forecast is that India will just barely surpass Japan by the end of 2025.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
India's economic performance falls short of expectations due to unforeseen events such as a significant domestic slowdown, adverse policy changes, a global economic shock, or major currency depreciation. Alternatively, if Japan experiences stronger-than-expected growth or yen appreciation, its nominal GDP could stay ahead, resulting in Japan retaining its fourth-largest economy status by year-end.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
India maintains or exceeds its current growth trajectory, and the exchange rate between the rupee and the US dollar holds steady or strengthens. Meanwhile, Japan's GDP remains flat or grows as projected, without unexpected positive shocks. Even minor positive adjustments to India's performance or negative ones for Japan would ensure India's nominal GDP overtakes Japan’s given the razor-thin projected gap.

## Rationale

- The IMF and major financial publications broadly concur that India is on track to overtake Japan in nominal GDP by the end of 2025[1][2][4][5].
- The projected difference is minuscule—less than a billion dollars—which means small changes in real economic growth, inflation rates, or currency values could reverse the outcome in either direction.
- Historically, economic rankings change slowly and, absent shocks, projections from credible organizations like the IMF tend to be reliable, especially when the lead is projected during a period of robust, consistent Indian growth and tepid Japanese expansion[2][5].
- However, the razor-thin margin increases uncertainty. Exchange rate volatility or unexpected macroeconomic shifts could tip the balance either way.
- Given the consistent and strong performance of India's economy, and absent evidence of imminent risk or reversal, the base rate (status quo) should be overweighted in the forecast. Good forecasters recognize that, in most periods, large surprises are atypical, especially over just eight months.

## Probability Estimate

Probability: 70%

This reflects a clear tilt toward "Yes" given the IMF's consensus, but with a meaningful allowance for the very real risk posed by the extremely narrow projected margin and external volatility.
