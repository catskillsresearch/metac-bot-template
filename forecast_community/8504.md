The United States is unlikely to sign a treaty banning Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) by 2031 due to several entrenched factors. Historically, the U.S. has consistently opposed a legally binding treaty on LAWS, emphasizing the adequacy of current international law and the strategic importance of maintaining its technological and military advantages. This stance is shared by other major military powers, such as Russia and China, which also resist such treaties, further complicating international consensus.

The definitional and verification challenges associated with LAWS present significant obstacles to treaty negotiations. These challenges make it difficult to establish clear and enforceable terms, which are crucial for any binding agreement. The lack of consensus among major military powers and the slow progress in international negotiations further solidify the status quo outcome.

However, a shift towards a treaty could occur under certain conditions. A significant global event, such as a major conflict involving LAWS with catastrophic consequences, could shift public and political opinion in the U.S. towards supporting a ban. Additionally, a change in U.S. political leadership, particularly one that prioritizes arms control and international cooperation, could lead to a reevaluation of the U.S. stance. Breakthroughs in international negotiations, possibly facilitated by a new consensus on definitions and verification mechanisms, could also pave the way for the U.S. to agree to a treaty.

Despite these potential scenarios, the current trajectory and historical trends suggest that the status quo outcome remains the most probable given the current information. The U.S. has a strong track record of resisting arms control measures that could limit its military capabilities, and the geopolitical landscape has not shown significant shifts that would favor a treaty.
