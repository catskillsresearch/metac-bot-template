# Elon Musk's Favorability Rating Forecast: June 25, 2025

## Current Situation Analysis

Elon Musk's public image has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past few years. His net favorability has plummeted from +24 in 2017 to current levels between -13 and -19. The Silver Bulletin polling average currently shows his net favorability at approximately -14.4, with his raw favorability rating hovering just below 38%.

This decline coincides with Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and his increased political activities. Multiple polls confirm this downward trend:

- CNN analysis shows his net favorability dropped from +24 in 2017 to -19 in 2025
- According to Morning Consult, 54% of voters view Musk unfavorably, up from 45% immediately after the November election
- Pew Research Center found that 54% of respondents report an unfavorable view of Musk, compared to 42% with a favorable view
- Associated Press polling indicates merely 33% of US adults regard Musk as "very or somewhat favorable"

## Recent Developments

Several key developments in May 2025 are relevant to this forecast:

1. **Government Role Termination**: Musk has officially stepped back from his government role, with reports indicating this occurred in early May 2025

2. **Public Criticism of Trump Administration**: Musk has recently expressed disappointment with Trump's fiscal plans, stating "I am disappointed to see a budget with enormous spending, which again increases the deficit" 

3. **Return to Business Focus**: Musk is shifting his attention back to his companies, particularly SpaceX and Tesla, with SpaceX hosting a "Road to Making Life Multiplanetary" event on May 27, 2025, and planning the Starship Flight 9 test

4. **Continued Political Polarization**: Despite stepping back from his formal government role, Musk remains a politically divisive figure. His support has become increasingly partisan, with 85% of Democrats reporting an unfavorable view compared to 73% favorability among Republicans

## Polling Dynamics and Status Quo Inertia

The Silver Bulletin polling average has displayed notable inertia recently, being less responsive to short-lived news cycles for several reasons:

1. **Decreased Polling Frequency**: There have been fewer polls measuring Musk's favorability since his resignation from government

2. **Conservative Tracker Settings**: The Silver Bulletin uses conservative settings for tracking Musk's ratings due to less frequent polling

3. **Established Perceptions**: Public opinion typically changes slowly, and the political polarization around Musk appears deeply established

His favorability has remained relatively stable between -13 and -16 net since April 2025, suggesting a status quo prediction would place his June 25th rating in approximately the same range.

## Potential Factors Affecting the Next 28 Days

Several factors could influence Musk's favorability rating between now and June 25:

1. **Political Disengagement Effects**: His stated withdrawal from politics might gradually reduce negative associations, though this effect would likely be slow and has shown no evidence of materializing yet

2. **Business Developments**: The upcoming SpaceX Starship Flight 9 test and potential Tesla announcements could generate positive publicity if successful

3. **Media Coverage**: With Musk stepping back from politics, media coverage has decreased, which reduces both opportunities for positive rehabilitation and risks of new controversies

4. **Partisan Entrenchment**: Musk's approval ratings show sharp partisan divides that are unlikely to shift dramatically in just 28 days

## Forecast Outlook

Given the established trend and recent developments, Musk's favorability rating is likely to remain relatively stable in the near term, with limited potential for significant change before June 25:

1. The long-term trend has been consistently negative with no evidence of reversal following his resignation from government

2. Public opinion typically changes slowly, especially when polling frequency has decreased

3. While potential positive developments with SpaceX or Tesla could generate good publicity, the established negative perceptions—particularly among Democrats—would be difficult to overcome in just 28 days

4. The Silver Bulletin's tracking methodology would likely dampen the impact of any short-term fluctuations

Without an extraordinary positive development—such as a groundbreaking SpaceX mission success or a major humanitarian gesture that receives widespread media attention—Musk's favorability is most likely to remain below 38% on June 25, 2025, continuing the established trend seen in recent polling.
