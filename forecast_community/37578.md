China has experienced three consecutive months of mild consumer price deflation, with year-on-year CPI readings at -0.7% in February 2025 and -0.1% in both March and April 2025. This consistent pattern suggests that deflationary pressures have stabilized rather than deepened, but there is no clear sign of reversal. The primary drivers behind this ongoing deflation include weak domestic demand, persistent consumer pessimism, high household debt, a sluggish housing market, and subdued credit growth. Producer prices have shown even greater weakness, with the Producer Price Index falling by 2.7% year-on-year in April—the sharpest drop in six months—marking a streak of over 30 consecutive months of producer deflation. Such sustained upstream deflation tends to reinforce subdued consumer prices.

Despite marginal improvements in economic indicators such as the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which rose to 49.5 in May from 49.0 in April, and a production sub-index moving into expansion at 50.7, overall manufacturing activity remains in contraction and has not yet translated into meaningful changes in consumer inflation. Business expectations and production sentiment have improved modestly, but leading indicators like credit demand and durable goods consumption continue to signal weak household and business spending.

Notably, key CPI components like food and non-food prices remain soft. Food prices saw only a slight uptick in April, insufficient to counteract broad-based weak demand, while non-food categories such as transport and durable goods experienced further declines. Energy prices also remain subdued, and there is no evidence of external shocks, seasonal effects, or major policy interventions in May capable of generating a swift return to positive price growth.

Trade tensions, particularly with the US, continue to challenge China’s export sector and economic sentiment, further weighing on both producer and consumer prices. Government stimulus efforts—such as interest rate cuts and liquidity support—have yet to show significant results in boosting inflation or reversing the downward trend in prices.

Given this context, the most likely scenario for May 2025 is a continuation of mild deflation. The data indicate ongoing structural and cyclical headwinds affecting both the demand and supply sides of the economy. In the absence of a major positive shock or powerful policy response, inertia in these trends suggests that a fourth consecutive month of consumer price deflation is probable.
