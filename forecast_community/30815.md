(a) **Time until question outcome is known:**  
About 5 months and 3 weeks remain. The question resolves when Argonne National Laboratory reports October 2025 full-month figures, typically by mid-November 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
As of Q1 2025, U.S. battery electric vehicles (BEVs) constitute approximately 7.5% of new light-duty vehicle sales, up from 7% in Q1 2024[1]. Growth remains positive but modest, with year-on-year BEV share gains usually in the 0.5–1 percentage point range[1]. Major industry forecasters expect BEV market share to hold steady or rise only slightly in 2025, with J.D. Power projecting a 9.1% BEV share for the full year[5]. If current trends continue, BEVs will remain below 10% of monthly new light-duty vehicle sales before October 2025.

(c) **A scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
The most likely scenario, based on current data and projections, is continued moderate growth in BEV sales volume, offset by robust overall new vehicle sales (due in part to post-pandemic recovery and recent tariff-driven inventory surges), plus rising competition from hybrids. BEV market share stays below the 10% monthly threshold through September 2025 and does not cross it before October 2025[1][5].

(d) **A scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A less likely but plausible scenario would involve a sudden uptick in BEV adoption, such as the launch and strong delivery of a mass-market, affordably priced electric vehicle, a temporary reinstatement or expansion of federal/state incentives, or a spike in gasoline prices. These could push monthly BEV share above 10% by late summer or early fall 2025. This would likely require a 2.5+ percentage point gain in share within a few months—much faster than current trends indicate and outpacing recent growth rates[1][5].

## Rationale

U.S. BEV market share is growing, but the pace has slowed compared to the 2021–2023 “tipping point” phase. As of Q1 2025, BEVs have not crossed the 10% monthly share threshold, sitting at 7.5%[1]. Recent months have shown uneven momentum: while new models from GM, Honda, and others have contributed incremental volume, overall growth is dampened by higher interest rates, uncertain policy support, competition from hybrids, and reduced demand for premium models[1][5].

Most credible industry forecasts for 2025 expect BEVs to account for about 9–10% of new LDV sales for the year, with few predicting a sustained or sudden jump above 10% in any given month before October[5]. Moreover, recent fluctuations in monthly sales—including several months of BEV sales declines and surges in total vehicle demand—suggest that the 10% mark is unlikely to be reached without significant near-term catalysts (policy, product, or economic shocks)[5].

Empirical international patterns point to 2–4 years for a market to grow from 5% to 10% BEV share after reaching the tipping point. The U.S. hit 5% in late 2021; thus, a mid-to-late 2025 crossing of the 10% threshold would be historically consistent, but the specifics of U.S. market structure and recent headwinds make earlier achievement uncertain. The current trajectory, barring a sudden external accelerant, supports a No outcome.
