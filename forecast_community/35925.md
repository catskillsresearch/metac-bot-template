The Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (Section 45X) currently requires that eligible components be manufactured in the United States, but neither statute nor regulation imposes any requirement that the materials or subcomponents used in those finished goods be of domestic origin. Manufacturers must produce finished goods in the U.S. and meet specific certification and eligibility criteria, but the underlying materials or parts can be sourced globally.

Recent legislative and regulatory developments reinforce this status quo. In 2025, the House, under Republican control, has prioritized efforts to phase down, limit, or repeal clean energy tax credits—including Section 45X—rather than expanding them or adding new mandates. House-passed bills and IRS/Treasury final regulations focus on restricting eligibility for credits on the basis of supply chain security—primarily by prohibiting the use of components or materials from specified "foreign entities of concern" such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea—instead of requiring a general domestic origin for all subcomponents. The emphasis is on national security and taxpayer exposure, not broad domestic sourcing.

Though recent administrative guidance for other tax credits (such as the domestic content bonus for the Section 45 and Section 48 credits) offers heightened incentives for projects meeting domestic material thresholds, these provisions are separate from the 45X credit. The domestic content bonus credit applies to energy generation and storage projects and offers a bonus if certain percentages of steel, iron, or manufactured products are mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S.. However, Section 45X’s own requirements remain distinctly focused on domestic manufacturing of the final eligible product, not its constituent materials.

Politically, there is strong rhetorical support for "Buy American" and "America First" in the current Republican-controlled Congress and administration, and international examples—such as Russia’s localization policies—underscore the plausibility of future sourcing mandates. Still, there is no public evidence as of late May 2025 of any enacted or pending federal legislation proposing a broad domestic content requirement for Section 45X. Even as supply chain tracking and certification requirements for credits have become more stringent, especially regarding critical minerals, these are about eligibility compliance and double-counting prevention, not mandates on sourcing subcomponents from U.S. suppliers.

Further, the internal divisions within the slim Republican House majority, the legislative focus on phasing out or limiting rather than restructuring credits, and industry concerns about supply chain disruption all create substantial inertia against the introduction of new domestic content rules for 45X. While it is technically feasible to layer on domestic materials requirements given the existing certification frameworks, the combination of political and practical factors means the focus remains on current eligibility and anti-foreign-entity rules rather than a sweeping mandate for domestic materials.

In summary, as of May 2025, the most likely scenario is that the 45X credit will continue to require only U.S.-manufacturing of finished components, with no new requirement for domestic materials or subcomponents. Legislative and regulatory efforts thus far have centered on exclusions for certain foreign entities and on altering credit phaseouts, not on fundamental new domestic sourcing mandates. Any future move to implement such requirements would need new federal legislation, which faces significant procedural and political barriers in the current environment.
