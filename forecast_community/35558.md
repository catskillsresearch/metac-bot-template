(a) The time left until the outcome is known: The outcome is already known, as the Canadian election has already taken place in April 2025, and the results have been reported.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: Mark Carney, the Liberal Party leader, is set to become Prime Minister as his party has won the most seats in Parliament.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: This has already occurred - Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his Conservative Party to victory but also lost his own parliamentary seat. The Liberals under Mark Carney won the election.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: This would require a massive error in the reported election results or an unprecedented constitutional intervention that would overturn the election outcome in favor of Poilievre, which is extremely unlikely given the clear reporting on the results.

Based on the search results provided, I can confidently state that Pierre Poilievre will not be elected Prime Minister of Canada in 2025. The Canadian federal election has already taken place in April 2025, and the results show that the Liberal Party led by Mark Carney has won more seats in Parliament than the Conservatives[2][3].

What's particularly notable is that Pierre Poilievre not only failed to lead his party to victory, but he also lost his own parliamentary seat representing his Ottawa district[2]. This represents a remarkable reversal of fortune for Poilievre, who only months before the election appeared to be a strong favorite to become Canada's next Prime Minister.

According to multiple sources, the Liberal Party under Mark Carney's leadership maintained a lead in the polls leading up to the election[3][4]. The final polling showed Carney's Liberals at 40.5% nationwide support, while Poilievre's Conservatives trailed at 37.5%[3]. The Liberals held a crucial 9-point lead in Ontario and also led in Quebec, which are important provinces for forming a government[3].

The election outcome appears to have been significantly influenced by increasing tensions with the United States, particularly related to trade issues and sovereignty concerns[2][3]. These tensions sparked a surge in Canadian nationalism that benefited the Liberal Party and hurt Poilievre, whose "Canada First" campaign slogan and perceived similarities to Trump's style of politics may have ultimately cost him and his party in the election[2].

While it's not entirely clear if the Liberals won an outright majority (requiring at least 172 seats in the 343-seat Parliament), they were projected to win the most seats and form the next government, either with a majority or with support from smaller parties like the NDP[2][4].

Given these facts, and that the election has already occurred with clear results reported by multiple credible sources, there is no realistic pathway for Pierre Poilievre to become Prime Minister of Canada in 2025.
