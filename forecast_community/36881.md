(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
Congress is aiming for final reconciliation bill passage by July 4, 2025, and the CBO cost estimate will follow shortly after possible enactment. Therefore, the outcome will be known by approximately the end of August 2025, or about 3–4 months from May 9.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
If no reconciliation bill is enacted and current law stays in place, total Medicaid spending from FY 2025 to FY 2034 will not change. The outcome would be a decrease of $0.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
Based on current legislative activity and reporting, House Energy & Commerce Committee is instructed to find $880 billion in Medicaid savings over 10 years, and there is no alternative source of significant mandatory spending cuts available within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the most likely outcome if the current trend continues is a Medicaid spending decrease of $880,000,000,000.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts and market analysts generally expect the reconciliation bill to include significant Medicaid cuts, with most reporting and analysis focusing on the $880 billion target for the Energy & Commerce Committee, which would require deep cuts to Medicaid. CBO and other credible sources have indicated that there are few alternatives to achieve this magnitude of savings other than Medicaid or Medicare, with Medicaid being the much larger and likelier target[1][2][5]. Experts note that the Senate’s approach could result in a lower figure, but the House’s $880 billion is the key guidance and starting point for negotiations.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
The House and Senate fail to resolve their differences on Medicaid cuts, or congressional leadership cannot secure enough votes to pass a bill; the bill is delayed until after FY 2025 and the question annuls, or a much smaller package is passed with only a fraction of the proposed savings.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
Additional revenue raisers are found outside of mandatory health programs, or only minor Medicaid cuts are enacted to satisfy a small fraction of the $880 billion target—perhaps if political backlash from proposed cuts grows and moderates demand alternatives.
