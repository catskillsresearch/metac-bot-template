(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 19 days (until December 31, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: No binding treaty with more than 34 countries committing to all five stringent anti-solar-geoengineering criteria exists.
(c) No scenario: Political momentum continues to build, but negotiations remain slow, resulting in either a less comprehensive agreement or one that doesn't reach the 35-country threshold by the deadline.
(d) Yes scenario: Rapidly accelerating climate impacts in 2025 create urgency, and the existing political momentum from African nations, European Parliament, and Pacific Islands coalesces into a formal treaty meeting all five criteria, with at least 35 countries ratifying by year-end.

As a professional forecaster, I need to assess the likelihood of more than 34 countries committing to a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact before 2026. Let me analyze the current situation and potential trajectories.

## Current State of Solar Geoengineering Governance

The governance of solar geoengineering (also called solar radiation modification or SRM) is currently in a transitional state. No comprehensive multilateral treaty exclusively addressing the full spectrum of geoengineering activities is in force[2]. However, there is growing momentum toward restricting solar geoengineering:

- The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) reaffirmed its moratorium on geoengineering in 2024[3]
- Political support for a "Non-Use Agreement" is increasing, with backing from:
  - The African Ministerial Conference on the Environment
  - The European Parliament
  - Pacific Island nations (led by Vanuatu and Fiji)
  - Germany has expressed willingness for dialogue on such an agreement[3]

Additionally, nearly 500 leading academics from over 50 countries and almost 2,000 civil society organizations have endorsed a non-use agreement for solar geoengineering[3].

## Key Barriers to a Stringent Treaty

Despite this momentum, several significant barriers make a binding treaty with more than 34 countries by the end of 2025 challenging:

1. **Stringency of Required Criteria**: The question requires all five stringent criteria to be met, including bans on experiments, deployment, government funding, patents, and international promotion. These comprehensive requirements make agreement more difficult.

2. **Transatlantic Divide**: A significant split exists between European and American positions. While European scientists advise an EU-wide moratorium and push for a global non-deployment agreement, the United States has repeatedly blocked efforts to open global conversations on solar geoengineering governance[5].

3. **Negotiation Timeframes**: International environmental treaties typically require extensive negotiation periods. For example, at the UN Environment Assembly in February 2024, countries failed to agree on how to regulate solar geoengineering techniques, with the US expressing doubts about a Swiss proposal to establish a UN expert group[4][5].

4. **Treaty Ratification Process**: Even if a treaty text were agreed upon soon, the formal ratification process by 35+ countries would likely extend beyond 2025, as this typically involves domestic legislative approval processes.

## Momentum Analysis and Historical Context

The most promising evidence for a Yes outcome is the increasing political momentum behind non-use:

- The EU backed the Africa Group's position during negotiations at the sixth session of the UN Environment Assembly[3]
- European scientists are advising EU policymakers to establish an EU-wide moratorium and push for a global non-deployment agreement[5]

However, historical precedents suggest caution. Previous international environmental agreements have taken years to negotiate and ratify. For example, the Paris Climate Agreement, despite its urgency and high profile, took several years to reach the threshold of countries needed for entry into force.

## Forecast Reasoning

Given the current trajectory, while momentum for restrictions on solar geoengineering is building, several factors weigh against having more than 34 countries formally commit to a stringent agreement meeting all five criteria by the end of 2025:

1. The existing governance mechanisms (like the CBD moratorium) provide some restrictions but don't satisfy all five criteria required by the question.

2. The transatlantic divide creates a significant obstacle, with the US actively hampering global governance efforts on this issue.

3. The negotiation timeline is extremely tightâ€”with just over 7 months remaining, countries would need to complete negotiation, drafting, signing, and national ratification processes at unprecedented speed.

4. The comprehensive nature of the required criteria makes agreement more difficult than a more limited approach.

While the current momentum could potentially accelerate, especially if climate impacts worsen dramatically in 2025, the procedural and political hurdles suggest that a binding treaty meeting all criteria and ratified by 35+ countries before 2026 remains unlikely.
