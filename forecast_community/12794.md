## Rationale for US Ambassador Appointment to Taiwan After Independence Declaration by 2035

The United States has not maintained formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 1979, operating within a framework of “strategic ambiguity” that aims to balance robust unofficial support for Taiwan with efforts to avoid direct confrontation with the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Under this policy, the US recognizes the government in Beijing as the sole legal government of China but maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, carried out through the American Institute in Taiwan rather than through an embassy with an ambassador.

In recent years, US-Taiwan relations have deepened significantly, underpinned by growing bipartisan support and increased US arms sales and political engagement. Notably, in February 2025, the US State Department updated its fact sheet on Taiwan-U.S. relations, removing the long-standing phrase: “we do not support Taiwan independence”. While this move hints at a more flexible, risk-tolerant posture toward Taipei, it has not been accompanied by concrete steps toward formal diplomatic recognition or appointment of an ambassador. Congressional resolutions calling for a break with the One China policy and appointment of an ambassador exist but remain the position of a minority and lack binding authority.

The PRC regards Taiwanese independence as a non-negotiable red line, consistently warning it would respond to any formal declaration of independence with strong measures, including potential military action. Chinese officials, reacting to shifts in US rhetoric and Taiwan’s political developments—such as the DPP’s continued emphasis on de facto sovereignty—have increased both military pressure and diplomatic warnings, underscoring the high risk of escalation.

For the US to appoint an ambassador within a year of a Taiwanese declaration of independence by 2035 would require a sequence of extraordinary events. First, Taiwan would need to take the significant risk of a formal independence declaration—a move it has historically refrained from, given the DPP’s preference for maintaining the status quo of practical autonomy, which avoids triggering a regional crisis with China. Second, the US would need to fundamentally break from decades of strategic ambiguity and the One China policy, openly recognizing Taiwan’s sovereignty. This would only be plausible if US-China relations had already collapsed, such as in the wake of direct Chinese military aggression against Taiwan or a broader geopolitical rupture—circumstances where the diplomatic cost of recognition was rendered moot by existing conflict or strategic necessity.

Incremental signals—such as the 2025 State Department fact sheet change and rare, nonbinding Congressional proposals—reflect a willingness to test the boundaries of established US policy, but they fall far short of a commitment to formal recognition or ambassadorial exchange. These moves are best interpreted as leverage in ongoing US-China strategic negotiations rather than evidence of a decisive shift.

Given the durable incentives for the US to avoid outright confrontation with China, the entrenched nature of the One China policy, the persistent deterrence posed by the possibility of war, and Taiwan’s own reluctance to trigger a crisis, both Taiwan declaring independence and the US appointing an ambassador remain unlikely in the absence of a dramatic upheaval. The inertia of international systems—particularly among major powers—makes sudden policy reversals rare unless they are precipitated by major, system-altering events.

In summary, despite deepening unofficial ties and subtle shifts in diplomatic language, the risk of military escalation, the costs to US-China relations, and the enduring advantages of strategic ambiguity collectively point to a low likelihood that the US would appoint an ambassador to Taiwan within a year of a formal independence declaration before 2035.
