The historical trend of avoiding large-scale conflict in the Taiwan Strait, combined with significant international deterrence factors, suggests that the status quo is likely to persist. Diplomatic efforts and strategic deterrence, particularly by the US and its allies, play a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. Economic interdependence and global diplomatic pressure further dissuade the PRC from engaging in military aggression against Taiwan. However, the increased military activity and explicit timelines for potential conflict, such as the PLA's centenary in 2027 and the PRC's 100th anniversary in 2049, indicate a non-negligible risk of escalation. Rising tensions and military posturing could lead to an accidental or intentional exchange of fire, potentially triggered by a miscalculation or a deliberate decision by the PRC to assert control over Taiwan. The potential for miscalculation or accidental escalation exists, which could lead to a conflict resulting in significant casualties. Given the long time horizon until 2050, there is ample opportunity for changes in political dynamics, leadership, and international relations that could either mitigate or exacerbate tensions. While the probability of conflict is not negligible, the world often changes slowly, and the status quo outcome should be given extra weight.
