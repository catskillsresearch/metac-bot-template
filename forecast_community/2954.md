Centuries-long population forecasting involves extreme uncertainty due to the vast array of social, technological, medical, and environmental variables at play. The United Nations’ authoritative central projection for the global biological human population in 2300, conditional on there being more than 500 million, expects stabilization near 9 billion, assuming fertility rates settle at replacement levels and that catastrophic events are avoided. This scenario is underpinned by long-term trends of declining fertility rates—especially in developed regions—balanced by ongoing growth in Africa and modest increases in global life expectancy. 

Small deviations from projected fertility rates, even as little as a quarter of a child per woman above or below the replacement level, can compound over centuries to yield enormous shifts in population—ranging from a low scenario of 2.3 billion to a high scenario of 36 billion by 2300, as established in the UN’s projection variants. This immense variance illustrates the sensitivity of long-term forecasts to minor demographic changes. Moreover, new modeling efforts suggest a wide credible interval for 2300, with median outcomes near 7–9 billion and plausible bounds from roughly 2 to 26 billion, reflecting high uncertainty intrinsic to such long-range projections.

Unexpected scenarios could radically reshape these outcomes. One low-end scenario involves a global, sustained collapse in fertility—potentially triggered by advanced AI automating most jobs and eroding economic incentives for childbearing, or through persistent socioeconomic, cultural, or technological change—causing population decline far beyond current mainstream forecasts. In extreme cases, persistent ultra-low fertility could drive population toward the 500 million threshold or even lower, although such scenarios remain speculative outliers.

Conversely, breakthroughs in life-extending medicine—such as anti-aging therapies, genetic interventions, or rejuvenation technologies—could increase average lifespans significantly. If such developments coincided with a stabilization or rebound in global fertility rates (potentially due to pro-natalist policies, cultural shifts, or successful space colonization opening new frontiers), populations could greatly exceed today’s expectations, even reaching or surpassing the upper bounds of current projections.

Ultimately, while the consensus among leading demographers puts the most weight on a global population stabilizing near 9 billion in 2300—conditional on exceeding 500 million—the range of credible outcomes remains vast. This reflects the inherent unpredictability of technological, environmental, and socio-cultural evolution over almost three centuries, with expert opinion and probabilistic models acknowledging both the possibility of severe population decline and of transformative growth well above the central scenario.
