The likelihood of China implementing a comprehensive ban on abortion and contraception by 2051 is influenced by several factors. Currently, China is pursuing a trajectory of incremental restrictions and pro-natalist policies rather than a full ban. This approach is driven by the need to address demographic challenges, such as a declining birth rate and an aging population, without provoking significant public backlash or international criticism.

The Chinese government is likely to continue exploring a range of strategies to boost birth rates, including financial incentives for larger families, cultural campaigns, and targeted restrictions on certain contraceptive methods. These measures aim to maintain some level of reproductive freedom, which is crucial to avoid public resistance and the rise of feminist consciousness that could oppose more extreme measures.

While the centralized authority of the Chinese political system allows for rapid policy changes, the implementation of a comprehensive ban would face significant barriers. Public resistance, both domestically and internationally, could be substantial, and the government may prefer less controversial and more effective alternatives to achieve its demographic goals.

Historical precedents, such as Romania's Decree 770, provide some context but do not necessarily predict China's future actions due to differing political, social, and economic environments. The slow pace of change in reproductive policies and the potential for public and international pushback further reduce the likelihood of a comprehensive ban. However, if demographic pressures intensify and other measures fail, the possibility of more drastic actions cannot be entirely ruled out.
