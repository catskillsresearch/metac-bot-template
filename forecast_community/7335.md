(a) Time left until outcome is known: 0 days.
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Internet freedom continues to decline globally, with more countries experiencing deterioration than improvement.
(c) Scenario for a No outcome: The 2025 Freedom on the Net report shows more countries improving their internet freedom scores than declining, reversing the multi-year trend of deterioration.
(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The 2025 Freedom on the Net report maintains the historical pattern, showing more countries with declining internet freedom scores than improving ones.

Based on the available information, I need to determine whether Freedom House has reported that internet freedom declined every year until 2025, with more countries experiencing decreases than increases in their scores.

## Historical Trends Analysis

Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2025 report, released in February 2025, documented that global freedom declined for the 19th consecutive year in 2024[3]. The report states that "people experienced deterioration in their political rights and civil liberties in 60 countries, and secured improvements in only 34 countries"[3]. This pattern of decline is consistent with previous years, showing a persistent global trend.

While the search results don't provide the specific 2025 Freedom on the Net report (which focuses specifically on internet freedom rather than general freedom), we can draw inferences from the broader Freedom House reporting patterns and related information.

## Internet Freedom Specific Evidence

The most recent internet freedom data available shows that in 2024, Iceland was the worldwide leader in internet freedom with 94 index points in the Freedom House Index, followed by Estonia with 92 points and Canada with 86 points[5]. This indicates that Freedom House continued its internet freedom assessments through at least 2024.

The historical context provided in the query background indicates that as of 2020, internet freedom had declined for ten consecutive years. Based on this established pattern and the continued general decline in global freedom documented in the 2025 Freedom in the World report, there is strong evidence suggesting that internet freedom specifically has continued its downward trajectory.

## Global Digital Rights Context

Several factors suggest continued pressure on internet freedom worldwide:

1. The search results mention "the rise of technology giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft dominating the dissemination of information and contributing to the decline" in press freedom, which likely impacts internet freedom as well.

2. Reports of internet shutdowns and restrictions in various countries continued through 2024, with significant economic impacts reported in places like Russia.

3. The continued trend of authoritarian practices and violence during elections noted in the Freedom in the World 2025 report likely extends to digital spaces.

## Consideration of Countervailing Evidence

While there's no direct evidence in the search results of a reversal in internet freedom decline, it's worth noting some potential factors that could have led to improvement:

1. Increased awareness and advocacy around digital rights
2. Potential policy reforms in some countries
3. Technological advancements enabling greater access or privacy protections

However, the overwhelming evidence points to continued decline rather than improvement in global internet freedom.

## Final Assessment

Given the documented 19-year consecutive decline in global freedom through 2024, the specific examples of internet restrictions continuing in various countries, and the absence of any evidence suggesting a reversal in internet freedom trends, it is highly probable that Freedom House reported internet freedom declining every year until 2025, maintaining the pattern established in previous years.

Probability: 92%
