The persistent decline in internet freedom observed globally over the past decade has been driven by entrenched and intensifying trends. Freedom House’s annual reports document that, for at least ten consecutive years prior to 2024, more countries experienced a net decline than an improvement in their internet freedom scores. This sustained negative trajectory is closely linked to rising digital authoritarianism: governments have increasingly implemented internet shutdowns, imposed content restrictions, and expanded surveillance, especially during moments of political crisis, protest, or conflict.

Notable recent events further illustrate this trend. For example, Russia intensified online restrictions following its invasion of Ukraine, targeting major social media platforms with sustained blocks and censorship. Iran executed broad internet shutdowns during periods of social unrest, aiming to stifle protest organization and communication. Other countries, such as Myanmar and India, have also imposed prolonged and large-scale service disruptions that affected tens of millions of people and led to significant economic losses—over $23 billion globally in 2022, with Russia and India among the most severely impacted.

These internet-specific trends are part of a broader global phenomenon of shrinking civic and political space. The 2025 *Freedom in the World* report highlights that global freedom declined for the 19th consecutive year in 2024, with more countries losing ground in civil liberties and political rights than gaining. The factors underpinning these declines—state violence, repression of opposition, manipulated elections, and the spread of authoritarian practices—also fuel the deterioration of online freedoms.

The momentum toward reduced internet freedom is maintained by the slow pace of structural change globally. Efforts to liberalize digital spaces or implement robust digital rights protections have thus far been too limited and localized to counterbalance the prevailing negative trend. No evidence from recent reporting suggests a significant global reversal; isolated improvements in individual countries are far outweighed by the number and weight of countries moving toward greater restrictions.

For a reversal of this pattern, there would need to be widespread and sustained liberalizing reforms across multiple nations—something not indicated in the latest reports or international developments. Absent such a shift, and given the inertia typical of global freedom trends, the expectation is that Freedom House will continue to report declining internet freedom for every year through 2025, reflecting the ongoing dominance of restrictive state practices over digital rights and access.
