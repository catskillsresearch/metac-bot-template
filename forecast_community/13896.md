## Rationale for the Number of ASAT Tests by 2030

There are approximately 4.5 years remaining until January 1, 2030, the cutoff date for counting kinetic Anti-Satellite (ASAT) tests. Since December 12, 2022, there have been zero publicly reported, successful, and sanctioned kinetic ASAT tests—the kind that typically draw global attention due to the risks they pose to space sustainability. If this status quo persists, the total number of such tests in this period would be zero.

Historically, kinetic ASAT tests have been infrequent, averaging about 1–2 per decade and usually conducted by a handful of major spacefaring nations: the United States, Russia, China, and, more recently, India. These rare tests often become focal points of international scrutiny and condemnation due to the persistent orbital debris they generate, which threatens the long-term usability of space for all actors. Recent examples, such as China's 2007 test, have sparked intense debate and led to calls for greater regulation or outright bans on debris-generating ASAT activities.

Expert and market forecasts broadly expect a small number of successful kinetic ASAT tests by 2030, typically in the range of 1 to 4. The most probable scenario centers around 1–3 tests, with a roughly 20% chance of zero tests and around a 20% chance of more than three. The likelihood of 10 or more tests is extremely remote and dependent on highly disruptive events such as a major state-to-state conflict in space. Several deterrents underlie these expectations, including:

- Escalating international pressure and reputational risks associated with debris generation, making such tests diplomatically and economically costly.
- The significant risk kinetic ASATs pose to all space actors, fueling discussions on multilateral agreements or moratoriums and sometimes leading to proposals for legally binding treaties or voluntary bans.
- The growing availability and preference for non-kinetic ASAT approaches (e.g., cyber-attacks, jamming, directed energy), which allow states to demonstrate counter-space capabilities without producing dangerous debris.

The potential for a very low number of tests hinges on the successful negotiation and enforcement of international norms, treaties, or moratoriums—possibly catalyzed by renewed concern over space debris or specific technological developments such as nuclear-armed ASAT threats. In such a scenario, major space powers could shift almost entirely to non-destructive or covert means, resulting in zero or, at most, one kinetic test within the timeframe.

Conversely, the prospect of a higher number of tests is primarily tied to the escalation of geopolitical tensions or the outbreak of direct conflict between major powers. A severe breakdown in space governance or a deliberate campaign of reciprocal ASAT demonstrations could produce a brief surge in kinetic tests, potentially reaching the high single digits. However, such a scenario would represent an unprecedented departure from current practice and faces strong structural and international constraints.

In summary, barring extraordinary developments, the number of reported, successful, and sanctioned kinetic ASAT tests by 2030 is expected to remain low, with the most likely outcomes shaped by ongoing deterrents, historical precedent, and the complex incentives of major spacefaring nations.
