Assuming that a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement is reached within the near future, the definitive outcome will be determined by how the conflict is characterized one year after that agreement is implemented. Given the current situation—with relatively static frontlines, mutual concessions during negotiations, and significant international pressure favoring compromise—it is most plausible that both sides will agree to a negotiated settlement rather than achieving a decisive military victory. Consequently, documentation of the conflict’s resolution (for example, on platforms that summarize outcomes) is likely to reflect a stalemate or neutral outcome.

There remains, however, a possibility for unexpected twists. Should one party secure a sudden and significant breakthrough—whether through a rapid military offensive, a pivotal diplomatic shift, or a dramatic realignment of international alliances—this could substantially alter the balance of power. In such a scenario, the narrative surrounding the conflict might shift to highlight one side’s decisive advantage. Yet, under current trends, such a decisive reversal appears unlikely, and the overall balance of concessions and pressures makes a clearly defined victory by either side an improbable outcome.

Overall, the prevailing expectation is for the outcome to be recorded as a negotiated resolution without a clear victor, while retaining a nonzero possibility that unexpected events could tip the scales decisively in favor of one side.
