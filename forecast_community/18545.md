Over the next 25 years, US aircraft carriers are expected to continue operating with robust, layered defenses and ongoing technological upgrades. The historical record shows that since World War II, carriers have proven resilient—even in times of conflict—due largely to their continuous modernization and sophisticated defensive systems. In a situation where conflicts are limited in scope or where advances in offensive technologies remain within predictable bounds, these carriers would likely sustain only manageable damage, benefiting from the same proven operator and coalition support that has characterized their deployment for decades.

That said, there remains a plausible scenario in which a high-intensity confrontation emerges, particularly with near-peer adversaries. In such a case, adversaries employing breakthrough offensive capabilities—such as hypersonic anti-ship missiles, advanced cyber or electronic warfare tactics, or other unconventional weapons—could potentially coordinate a surprise, large-scale assault. If these advanced systems were to overwhelm the intricate multilayered defenses, the resulting damage might be severe enough to force a carrier’s decommissioning or cause its catastrophic loss.

Balancing the longstanding trend of durability through continuous improvements against the risk of an unforeseen escalation involving breakthrough adversary technology provides a comprehensive view of the situation. While the backdrop of historical survivability and steady defensive enhancements strongly favors a continuation of current trends, the emerging risks inherent in next-generation offensive capabilities mean that the possibility of a carrier’s destruction, though low, cannot be entirely dismissed.
