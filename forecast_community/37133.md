# Will NOAA's Climate.gov Still Be Online on July 1, 2025?

Climate.gov is currently fully operational and actively publishing new content as of May 21, 2025. The site has published recent climate outlooks and ENSO updates, including the May 2025 U.S. climate outlook released on May 2, 2025, and ENSO information updated on May 8, 2025. The site was confirmed to be "UP and reachable" by Is It Down Right Now? as recently as May 7, 2025.

## Current Status and Recent Activity

NOAA's Climate.gov serves as a primary portal for climate information used by various sectors, including business, agriculture, and emergency management. The search results show that the site is actively maintained and publishing new content, demonstrating its continued operational status. Given that the resolution date is only 40-41 days away, the status quo strongly favors Climate.gov remaining online, as it would take direct action to take down a currently functioning website.

## Political Climate and Administration Actions

There are some concerning trends regarding climate data access under the current administration:

- NOAA has announced the discontinuation of its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, with the data being archived but no longer updated.
- Reports indicate significant budget and staff cuts to NOAA, including mass layoffs of scientists and climate experts in February 2025.
- Some NOAA regional climate centers experienced temporary shutdowns due to funding "lapses," though they were subsequently restored.
- The administration has reportedly ordered the National Science Foundation to stop funding all new and existing climate research.

## Factors Supporting Continued Operation

Despite these concerning signals, several factors suggest Climate.gov will likely remain online on July 1:

1. When concerns about NOAA websites shutting down emerged in April 2025, NOAA explicitly stated: "There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online."

2. The pattern of changes appears to be selective reduction of climate services rather than wholesale elimination - for example, discontinuing updates to the disaster database while maintaining the archive.

3. Climate.gov continues to publish new content as recently as May 8, 2025, showing no immediate signs of shutdown.

4. There has been no specific announcement targeting Climate.gov for closure, unlike the explicit announcement about the Billion-Dollar Disaster database.

5. Even when some regional climate centers experienced funding lapses, they were restored after a brief period, suggesting essential climate resources maintain priority.

## Risk Assessment

The main risks to Climate.gov's continued operation over the next 41 days are:

- An unforeseen technical failure (e.g., server outage, cyberattack)
- A rapid, unannounced policy change resulting in the site's removal or blocking

Both scenarios are theoretically possible but not suggested by current trends or news. Abrupt site takedowns are rare without public warning, and as of May 21, there are no active threats or scheduled changes affecting Climate.gov's public accessibility.

Given the institutional inertia, recent patterns, and lack of new credible threats to the site, the base-rate expectation is that Climate.gov will remain online through July 1, 2025. The site's continued recent updates suggest it remains a priority, and good forecasting practice puts added weight on the status quo continuing, especially as government websites like this have proven resilient even amid controversy and partial retrenchment.
