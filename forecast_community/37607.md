A review of the geopolitical and informational landscape as of early June 2025 strongly supports the expectation that, by the end of June 2025, Wikipedia will still list China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as “currently” blocking access to X (formerly Twitter).

The bans in these seven countries are deeply entrenched and have been in place for years—often as part of broader strategies to control information and restrict independent digital communication. Authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes, which characterize all the countries in question, typically demonstrate a high degree of policy durability when it comes to internet censorship. These blocks are not only long-standing but also driven by persistent political motivations, such as suppressing dissent and maintaining governmental authority. Such regimes rarely alter censorship policy quickly or in response to short-term events.

Recent developments in global internet censorship reinforce the stability of the current status quo. For example, while new blocks have emerged elsewhere—such as Tanzania blocking X in June 2025—these do not affect the original set of seven countries relevant to this question. Meanwhile, reversals do occur (as seen with Pakistan restoring access to X in May 2025), but these are exceptions, typically requiring sustained political pressure, negotiation, or a substantial shift in domestic priorities. None of the seven currently blocking countries have shown any credible or public indications of policy reconsideration, ongoing negotiations, or diplomatic breakthroughs likely to change the status quo in the immediate future.

With less than a month until the outcome is assessed, the short time horizon further reduces the probability of significant policy change. Government decisions regarding information control are typically slow-moving, especially within countries where internet censorship forms a core aspect of political power. The status quo is further reinforced by the lack of any indication from X's side of new concessions or policy adjustments that might prompt reconsideration by these governments.

The Wikipedia page documenting the censorship of X is actively maintained and has seen recent updates, reflecting high responsiveness to major developments. However, even if a policy change were to occur close to the assessment date, there could be a natural lag between real-world changes and Wikipedia’s documentation. This lag makes it even more likely that the list of currently blocking countries would remain unchanged at the crucial moment.

In sum, the persistent historical trend, lack of any signals of imminent policy changes, short timeframe, and Wikipedia’s active but sometimes lagging update process, all strongly support the expectation that, at the end of June 2025, Wikipedia will continue to list all seven countries as “currently” blocking access to X. The potential for unexpected breakthroughs or sudden policy shifts always exists, but there is no current evidence to suggest such developments are imminent in any of these countries.
