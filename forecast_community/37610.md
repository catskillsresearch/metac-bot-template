Based on the search results from June 5, 2025, David Jolly has officially announced his candidacy for Florida governor as a Democrat. This announcement came after months of speculation and preparation, including registering a state political action committee in April and changing his party affiliation from no party to Democrat.

## Political Context and Timing

David Jolly, a former Republican U.S. Representative who served Tampa Bay from 2014 to 2017, has officially filed to run for governor of Florida. His announcement on June 5, 2025 makes him the first Democrat to enter the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race. This timing is significant as it positions him well ahead of the competition within the Democratic party, potentially giving him advantages in fundraising and coalition-building.

The political landscape Jolly faces is challenging. Florida has shifted from a traditional swing state to one that now leans decidedly right, with Donald Trump having won the state by 13 points in the 2024 presidential election. This rightward shift has left the Democratic party struggling to find viable candidates willing to contest statewide races.

## Jolly's Background and Transition

Jolly's political journey is notable. He was initially elected to Congress as a Republican in a 2014 special election, serving until 2017 when he lost his seat to Charlie Crist (ironically, another former Republican who became a Democrat). While some have drawn comparisons between Jolly and Crist, Jolly has rejected these parallels.

As a former Republican who left the party several years ago, Jolly represents a potential crossover candidate. He officially registered as a Democrat in April 2025, setting the stage for his gubernatorial run. His experience as a vocal Trump critic and his centrist positioning could be strategic in appealing to moderate voters in a state where the Democratic base alone is insufficient to win statewide.

## Campaign Focus and Competition

Jolly has identified several key issues for his campaign, including Florida's affordability crisis, public education funding, property insurance reform, and gun safety. He has framed his candidacy as being about more than opposition to Trump or DeSantis, stating: "The race is not about Donald Trump. It's not even about Ron DeSantis. It's about where he's leaving the state".

The gubernatorial race is expected to be complicated by a three-way contest. On the Republican side, Rep. Byron Donalds has secured establishment support and an endorsement from President Trump. Meanwhile, former Democratic state Sen. Jason Pizzo has indicated he plans to run as an independent, a move that many Democrats fear will split the opposition vote and benefit Republicans.

Jolly appears to be the most prominent Democrat willing to take on the challenge in a state where the party has struggled. Other potential Democratic candidates who had expressed interest a year ago have since backed away, highlighting the difficult electoral environment.
