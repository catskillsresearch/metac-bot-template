(a) **Time until outcome known:**  
Approximately 7.5 months remain until January 1, 2026, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends persist—with no public criminal investigations, all legal actions remaining civil, and no new, credible allegations—Sam Altman will not be indicted before 2026.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Ongoing lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny remain within the civil domain, governance controversies do not escalate to criminal proceedings, and no major evidence of criminal conduct emerges relating to Altman or OpenAI. By January 1, 2026, Altman has not been indicted on any state or federal charges.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
Significant new evidence surfaces—such as fraud, obstruction, or other criminal activity—either from ongoing civil litigation (such as the lawsuit with Elon Musk or from external investigations into OpenAI or related ventures like Worldcoin). Law enforcement launches a criminal investigation and secures an indictment of Altman before January 1, 2026.

## Rationale

The **default outcome in most corporate and tech governance disputes is “No indictment”**, especially when, as now, all known legal actions are civil and not criminal in nature. The numerous controversies surrounding Sam Altman—ranging from OpenAI’s governance disputes, his firing and reinstatement, to criticisms about transparency and treatment of employees—have certainly attracted regulatory and public scrutiny[1][2]. However, there are **no public criminal investigations or indictments as of May 2025**[2][4].

Historical reference cases (e.g., Holmes, Bankman-Fried) show that criminal indictments typically follow public revelations of fraud or egregious misconduct. At present, the board’s past concerns—misleading the board, psychological abuse allegations, or employee NDAs—have not translated into evidence of criminal conduct[2].

While ongoing lawsuits (notably with Elon Musk) and regulatory reviews could, in theory, uncover criminal wrongdoing, so far they remain in civil territory[1][4]. Even substantive civil findings rarely convert into criminal indictments absent concrete evidence of fraud, embezzlement, or similar offenses—none of which have surfaced publicly in Altman’s case.

Given the **short time remaining before 2026 and the current lack of public criminal investigation**, the probability of indictment is low. However, given the historic unpredictability in tech scandals, a nonzero probability remains, but it is heavily outweighed by the status quo.

**Probability: 3%**
