## Current Political Landscape in Serbia

The political situation in Serbia is one of managed stability following a period of uncertainty. In early 2025, Prime Minister Miloš Vučević resigned amid student-led protests that began after the collapse of a concrete roof at a railway station in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people. This resignation temporarily raised concerns about potential snap elections, especially if a new government couldn't be formed within the required 30-day period. However, the immediate political crisis was defused when Đuro Macut was nominated as Vučević's successor and was officially appointed as prime minister on April 16, 2025.

## Government Intentions and Statements

The Serbian leadership has consistently signaled their intention to avoid early elections. President Aleksandar Vučić announced in 2024 that the next parliamentary election and presidential election would be held simultaneously in 2027, making it a general election. This position has been echoed by government officials, with the former Prime Minister Vučević also stating that elections would not be held prior to 2027. The ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and its coalition partners have maintained this stance even as they navigated the formation of a new government following Vučević's resignation.

## Opposition and Protest Dynamics

Student-led protests that began following the Novi Sad tragedy have continued to apply pressure on the government, with demonstrators demanding accountability for those deemed responsible, alleging corruption and incompetence. However, these protests appear to be losing momentum as summer approaches. Importantly, the Serbian opposition is not unified in its approach to elections. Many opposition parties are refusing to participate in elections under current conditions, citing unfair election conditions including media dominance by the ruling party, command over country resources, and unresolved issues with the voter registry. Some opposition forces are more focused on pressuring for fairer electoral rules rather than immediate elections.

## Potential Scenarios

For a general election to be announced before July 1, 2025, one of several scenarios would need to unfold:

1. A sudden political crisis emerges—such as renewed mass protests, a government scandal, or defections from the ruling coalition—forcing the president or National Assembly to dissolve parliament and call early elections.

2. The SNS could make a strategic calculation that snap elections would be advantageous, despite their public commitment to stability. The party has historically used snap elections tactically, though all current signals point toward completing the full term.

3. External pressure or unforeseen events could create conditions where elections become unavoidable.

However, the baseline scenario remains one where the newly formed government under Prime Minister Macut continues to govern through the summer with its stable parliamentary majority, making no moves to dissolve parliament or call an early vote before July.

## Factors Weighing Against Early Elections

Several factors make an early election announcement unlikely:

- The ruling SNS party still commands a majority in parliament and has successfully formed a new government, removing the immediate legal trigger for snap elections.

- Summer is traditionally a period when mass mobilization is more difficult, reducing the likelihood that protests will force the government's hand.

- The opposition's fragmentation and reluctance to participate under current conditions reduces pressure for immediate elections.

- Political analyst Dragomir Anđelković has argued that the next parliamentary election would likely only be held after the completion of major projects like the Expo 2027 fair and the expansion of the Belgrade Waterfront project.

## Conclusion

The path of least resistance—and highest probability—is that no general election will be announced before July 1, 2025. While Serbian politics can change rapidly and snap election announcements can occur with little warning, such decisions typically follow either a clear loss of government stability or a strategic calculation by the ruling party—factors that appear currently absent. Only a major, disruptive event in the next 6.5 weeks could alter this trajectory, and while this remains possible, the current situation strongly favors political continuity through the summer of 2025.
