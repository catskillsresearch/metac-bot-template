# Rationale for Nigerian Banking Account Ownership

The question of whether 95% or more of Nigerian adults would have a bank account before 2025 requires examining historical trends, current data, and realistic growth projections in financial inclusion.

## Historical Progress and Current State

Nigeria has made steady but incremental progress in financial inclusion over the years. Financial inclusion grew from 29.7% in 2011 to 39.7% in 2017, then reached 56% by 2020, and 64% formal financial inclusion by 2023. Even when including all forms of financial inclusion (such as non-bank digital services), the overall rate was only about 74% in 2023.

The banking sector in Nigeria shows a significant disparity between the number of accounts and actual unique users:
- Active bank accounts numbered 311.6 million by December 2024
- Bank Verification Numbers (BVNs), which indicate unique account holders, stood at only 64.8 million as of January 2025
- This gap demonstrates that account ownership is concentrated among a segment of the population that holds multiple accounts

## Barriers to Financial Inclusion

Several persistent challenges have hindered Nigeria's ability to achieve the 95% target:

- **Gender disparities**: Only 47% of women accessed formal financial services in 2023, compared to 58% of men
- **Regional inequalities**: Northern regions continue to experience higher exclusion rates than Southern regions
- **Economic factors**: Poverty, high inflation, and economic instability limit participation in the formal financial system
- **Infrastructure limitations**: Inadequate banking infrastructure in rural areas restricts access
- **Trust issues**: Lack of trust in financial institutions remains a barrier for many Nigerians
- **Financial literacy gaps**: Limited understanding of financial products and services

## Required Growth Rate vs. Reality

To reach the 95% threshold by January 2025 would have required an extraordinary acceleration in account ownership:

- From 2020 to 2023, formal financial inclusion grew by about 8 percentage points over three years (56% to 64%)
- Reaching 95% by January 2025 would have required a 31 percentage point increase in just over a year
- This represents nearly four times the rate of progress observed in the previous three years
- The consistent annual growth rate of 2.7-4 percentage points would put the 95% target more than a decade away

## Recent Initiatives and Their Impact

While Nigeria has implemented various initiatives to boost financial inclusion, these efforts have not produced the dramatic acceleration needed:

- A Presidential Committee on Economic and Financial Inclusion was inaugurated in February 2025, indicating that even in early 2025, significant work was still needed
- The Aso Accord was established to facilitate universal access to financial services
- Microfinance banks have played an expanding role, with 95.66% of bank debtors in 2024 borrowing from microfinance institutions rather than traditional banks

## Banking Sector Outlook for 2025

Looking at the banking sector performance in 2025:
- Credit losses are expected to remain elevated at about 2.5%-3.0% in 2025
- Banks are projected to maintain strong financial performance with an average return on equity of 20%-25%
- Overall bank capitalization is expected to improve as banks raise capital to meet new paid-up requirements

Despite these positive indicators for the banking sector itself, there is no evidence of a disruptive event or policy capable of bridging the massive gap in financial inclusion before January 2025. The consistent data from multiple sources all confirm that Nigeria remained well below the 95% target as of early 2025.
