DOGE has claimed $175 billion in total savings as of May 26, 2025, following a steady pattern of growth—approximately $15 billion added over the previous month. The initiative’s trajectory has been consistent since early 2025, but recent days suggest a possible plateau, indicating that the rate at which new savings are identified may be slowing as the most accessible opportunities have already been captured. This loss of momentum is compounded by concerns that increased scrutiny, the possibility of double-counted or overstated figures, and the administrative transition from Elon Musk to the Office of Management and Budget could introduce further bottlenecks or reporting slowdowns.

Nonetheless, DOGE’s own reporting makes it clear that only about 30% of total identified savings have been fully documented and published on their website. The agency maintains weekly updates and has signaled plans for more rapid reporting going forward, providing multiple chances in the month ahead to boost the official tally. There are strong political and public-relations incentives for the program’s leadership to reach the symbolic $200 billion milestone, especially given the visibility of the target and ambitious future goals. 

Because a large proportion of savings remains to be formally documented, DOGE could feasibly accelerate reporting by uploading backlogged or aggregated savings, or by releasing a large batch of previously unreported savings from categories like contract and grant terminations. This presents a realistic avenue for a sudden jump in the claimed total, even if the substantive quality or independent verification of such claims remains disputed. 

While the status quo growth rate would leave DOGE just shy of $200 billion by July 1, the combination of a large backlog, regular update cadence, the possibility of a “catch-up” upload, and the pronounced motivation to reach a high-profile milestone create a substantial likelihood that the agency claims $200 billion or more by the deadline. The key risks are that increased scrutiny or administrative changes could delay or force revisions to reported figures, but if DOGE prioritizes milestone claims, these headwinds may be outweighed by the mechanisms and incentives available for rapid reporting in the final weeks.
