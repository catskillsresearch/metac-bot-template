(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 22 days (until December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Bitcoin would close 2025 above $93,429.20, as it is currently trading at approximately $102,720 as of May 9, 2025.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: A severe market crash occurs in late 2025 due to unexpected regulatory crackdowns globally, major security breaches at exchanges, or macroeconomic deterioration leading to massive selloffs of risk assets. Bitcoin could fall below $93,429.20 by year-end amid panic selling and liquidity crisis.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Continued institutional adoption through ETFs, favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration, and increasing mainstream acceptance push Bitcoin to maintain and build upon its current price levels, closing the year well above $93,429.20.

Based on the current search results and market conditions, I can provide a comprehensive forecast regarding Bitcoin's price trajectory through the end of 2025.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $102,720 as of May 9, 2025[1], which is already approximately 10% above the threshold price of $93,429.20 specified in the resolution criteria. This establishes a fairly strong starting position for a "Yes" outcome if the status quo merely persists.

## Current Price Trends and Technical Analysis

Bitcoin is displaying a bullish trend structure in May 2025, supported by both macro factors and increased governmental acceptance. The current technical analysis suggests Bitcoin could reach between $108,000 and $110,000 by the end of May 2025, with price targets for the coming days showing a consistent upward trajectory[1].

The daily price predictions for May show:
- May 9: $102,720
- May 10: $103,210
- May 11: $104,302
- May 12: $105,412
- May 13: $106,860[1]

These short-term projections indicate sustained momentum at least through mid-May, keeping Bitcoin well above the threshold.

## Expert Forecasts for Remainder of 2025

Multiple cryptocurrency analysis platforms have provided forecasts for Bitcoin through the end of 2025:

Changelly's analysis suggests that while there may be some volatility, Bitcoin is expected to trade at an average of $86,153.95 in December 2025, with a maximum projected price of $88,121.38[3]. This forecast is notably more conservative than others and falls below the threshold.

However, Longforecast predicts Bitcoin will be trading at approximately $135,628 at the beginning of December 2025, with a potential high of $168,341 during the month and an average monthly price of $149,231[5]. This forecast would put Bitcoin well above the threshold.

Binance's long-term forecast places Bitcoin at $102,923.50 by the end of 2025[2], which exceeds the resolution threshold by approximately 10%.

Other analyses suggest even more bullish outcomes, with some predictions ranging from $120,000 to $200,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2025[4].

## Key Factors to Consider

Several factors will likely influence Bitcoin's price trajectory through the end of 2025:

**Institutional Adoption**: The continued flow of funds into Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant stabilizing force that wasn't present in previous market cycles. This institutional interest provides a more sustainable support level.

**The $100K Psychological Barrier**: Bitcoin is currently trading above $100,000, a major psychological threshold. The search results indicate that "the $100K mark remains critical. A confirmed breakout could extend gains, while rejection might lead to a retest of support at $92Kâ€“$94K"[1]. This suggests that if Bitcoin maintains its position above $100,000, it could establish a new support level well above the resolution threshold.

**Macro Environment**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy will continue to play a crucial role. The search results mention that Bitcoin's trend "will depend on macro clarity and whether the market sustains momentum post-Fed"[1].

**Market Cyclicality**: Historical patterns suggest that crypto markets experience significant volatility, including substantial corrections even during bull markets. The potential for a 30-40% correction during 2025 cannot be ruled out.

## Weighing the Probabilities

Given that Bitcoin is currently trading approximately 10% above the threshold, the status quo favors a "Yes" outcome. For Bitcoin to close below $93,429.20, it would need to experience a decline of more than 10% from current levels and maintain that lower level through the end of the year.

While December 2025 forecasts vary significantly, most analysts expect Bitcoin to trade above the threshold by year-end. The most conservative forecast from Changelly suggests a potential closing price below the threshold[3], but this is an outlier compared to other predictions.

Taking into account:
1. The current price level ($102,720) already exceeds the threshold
2. The majority of expert forecasts predict higher prices by year-end
3. The pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration
4. Increasing institutional adoption

However, I must also consider:
1. The historical volatility of cryptocurrency markets
2. Potential regulatory uncertainties that could emerge
3. The possibility of macroeconomic headwinds
4. The conservative forecast suggesting a potential December dip
