The likelihood of a non-state actor developing a nuclear weapon by 2030 is extremely low, given the robust international frameworks and historical precedents. The current non-proliferation measures, including the NPT, IAEA safeguards, and UN Security Council resolutions, are highly effective in preventing the acquisition of necessary materials and technology by non-state actors. These frameworks are supported by enhanced surveillance and intelligence capabilities that detect and deter any attempts at nuclear development.

Non-state actors face significant technical, logistical, and security barriers in developing a nuclear weapon. The acquisition of fissile material is tightly controlled, and the technical expertise required to develop a deployable weapon is substantial. The global community remains vigilant, with strong cooperation and intelligence-sharing preventing significant lapses in nuclear material security.

While emerging technologies and geopolitical instability could pose challenges, the international community's commitment to non-proliferation and the effectiveness of existing frameworks make a successful development by a non-state actor highly improbable. The possibility of such an outcome cannot be entirely dismissed, but the status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome, with the probability of a non-state actor developing a nuclear weapon by 2030 remaining well below 1%.
