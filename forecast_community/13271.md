(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
About 7.5 months remain, as the question covers lunar landings through the end of 2025 and today is May 12, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of today, there have been 3 confirmed qualifying lunar landings between 2022 and 2025:
- Chandrayaan-3 (India) in 2023
- Chang’e 6 (China) in 2024
- Intuitive Machines IM-1 (USA) in 2024

Astrobotic’s Peregrine, Japan’s SLIM, and others failed or did not transmit after landing, so do not meet the criteria. Thus, status quo = 3 spacecraft.

(c) **Outcome if the current trend continued:**  
At least two more US commercial landers (e.g., Intuitive Machines IM-2, Astrobotic Griffin, possibly IM-3) are scheduled for 2025, but historical trends of roughly 50% success imply 1–2 more successes are likely. If so, this would bring the total to 4–5 spacecraft for 2022–2025.

(d) **Expectations of experts and markets:**  
- Expert commentary consistently notes high technical risk and frequent delays for lunar landers, especially among new commercial providers.
- NASA’s Artemis crewed landing (which would also qualify if it occurred) is delayed until at least 2026[2][3].
- Analysts and media highlight that, while 18 landings were on schedules, actual successful soft landings with data transmission are tracking well below that pace, with a likely range of 4–6 by the end of 2025[3][5].

(e) **Unexpected scenario for a low outcome:**  
A major technical setback (e.g., unanticipated failure mode in commercial lunar landers or a launch vehicle fleet grounding) leads to all remaining 2025 missions failing or being delayed beyond 2025. In this outcome, the total remains at 3.

(f) **Unexpected scenario for a high outcome:**  
Surprisingly robust performance by remaining 2025 missions—e.g., all 4 major contenders land successfully and transmit data—or an unannounced or under-the-radar government mission succeeds. In this case, the total could reach 6 or more.
