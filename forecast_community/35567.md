(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just under eight months left in 2025. The outcome will be known by December 31, 2025.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early May 2025, Rockstar Games had been officially targeting a Fall 2025 release for Grand Theft Auto VI, with historical precedent suggesting a simultaneous global launch for Europe and other major markets[1][2][4]. However, on May 2, 2025, Rockstar reportedly announced a delay, pushing the release to May 26, 2026, according to a statement shared on official channels[3].

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Grand Theft Auto VI is not released in Europe through standard, authorized channels by December 31, 2025—specifically, if the official delay to 2026 remains in effect and no regional/partial release occurs before the end of 2025[3].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Rockstar reverses its delay decision, or releases the game in Europe (possibly as a special, early, or partial launch) before the end of 2025 through official distribution channels. This would require either a new, earlier announcement or an unanticipated change in release strategy.

## Analysis and Rationale

Rockstar Games historically coordinates worldwide launches for its flagship titles, and until very recently, all credible official communication—including investor calls and public statements—indicated Grand Theft Auto VI would release globally (including Europe) in Fall 2025[1][2][4]. This expectation was reflected in market and community predictions, with forecasters giving an 82% probability to a 2025 European release as of early May 2025[1].

However, as of May 2, 2025, several reputable sources—including a report by Kotaku and statements attributed to Rockstar on official social media—now indicate the release has been formally delayed to May 26, 2026, explicitly contradicting the prior 2025 window[3]. Rockstar Games has a pattern of delaying major titles (e.g., *Red Dead Redemption 2*), and there are no credible reports or leaks indicating the game will launch early in any region to circumvent this delay[3].

Given the official delay and Rockstar’s historical preference for synchronized global launches (not region-staggered releases), the most likely scenario is that Grand Theft Auto VI will **not** be available for sale in Europe in 2025[3]. The status quo has shifted decisively in favor of a "No" outcome, barring extraordinary, unforeseen changes.

## Probability Assessment

Rockstar's formal delay announcement dramatically lowers the chances of a 2025 European release. While corporate U-turns can occur, such reversals after public statements are extremely rare, especially for a project of this scale and scrutiny. There are currently no signals of a segmented, region-specific launch or loopholes that would fulfill the criteria "within 2025" for Europe.
