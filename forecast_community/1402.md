(a) Time left until outcome is known: The Parker Solar Probe was launched on August 12, 2018, and is on a seven-year mission to complete 24 loops around the Sun. Based on this timeline, the mission should complete its 24th perihelion around mid-2025, which means we're just a few months away from knowing the final outcome.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Currently, the Parker Solar Probe has successfully completed its 23rd close approach to the Sun as of March 22, 2025, reaching within approximately 6.1 million kilometers from the solar surface and achieving speeds of over 692,000 km/h. The spacecraft reported back that it was healthy and all systems were functioning normally after this approach.

(c) Scenario for a No outcome: The Parker Solar Probe could fail during its 24th and final perihelion passage if its thermal protection system becomes compromised after repeated exposure to extreme temperatures. Alternatively, critical instrument failure could occur due to cumulative radiation damage, or micrometeoroid impacts during the final approach could damage essential components. Any of these scenarios would prevent the probe from transmitting valid scientific data back to Earth after its final approach.

(d) Scenario for a Yes outcome: The Parker Solar Probe continues to function as designed through its 24th perihelion, with its carbon-composite heat shield continuing to protect the instruments effectively. The spacecraft maintains its autonomous operations capability and successfully transmits scientific data back to Earth after completing its final close approach to the Sun, with at least some approaches meeting the target specifications of approaching within 6.16 million kilometers of the Sun's surface.

The Parker Solar Probe represents one of NASA's most ambitious missions, designed to study our star closer than any spacecraft before. Based on the available information, I assess that the probe has a high probability of successfully completing its 24-loop mission around the Sun for several key reasons:

First, the spacecraft has already demonstrated remarkable resilience and engineering excellence. It has successfully completed 23 of its planned 24 perihelion passages, with the most recent one occurring in March 2025. During this approach, it reached within 6.1 million kilometers of the Sun's surface while traveling at speeds over 692,000 km/h, and subsequently reported back that all systems were functioning normally.

The spacecraft's design incorporates significant protective measures against the extreme environment near the Sun. Its 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite heat shield (Thermal Protection System) has proven effective at protecting the instruments, keeping them at around room temperature despite external temperatures reaching nearly 1,377°C. This heat shield weighs 73 kilograms and has a diameter of about 2.3 meters.

The probe's power systems have also performed admirably. Despite the harsh conditions, its solar arrays continue to produce the necessary power (about 388 watts) to maintain operations. The spacecraft's mass of about 635 kilograms includes sufficient hydrazine propellant for attitude control and trajectory corrections throughout the mission.

Furthermore, the spacecraft's autonomous operation capability has been crucial during close solar approaches when direct control from Earth is impossible due to communication delays and the intense environment. This autonomy has functioned as expected throughout the mission.

While there are still risks—including potential micrometeoroid impacts, cumulative radiation effects, and the extreme thermal environment—the fact that the probe has already successfully completed 23 of its 24 planned perihelion passages significantly reduces the uncertainty about its ability to complete the final approach.

The search results mention a recent close approach in March 2025 as the 23rd approach, indicating that only one more remains to complete the mission requirements. Given the spacecraft's demonstrated reliability thus far and the successful engineering of its protective systems, the most likely outcome is that it will survive its final perihelion passage and continue to transmit valid scientific data back to Earth.

Probability: 92%
