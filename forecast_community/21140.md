# Will the CDU Announce Openness to Negotiating with the AfD Before 2030?

## Current Political Landscape in Germany

As of June 2025, Germany is governed by a newly formed "Grand Coalition" between the CDU/CSU and SPD, with Friedrich Merz as Chancellor. This coalition was established following the February 2025 federal election, where the CDU/CSU won with approximately 28.5% of the vote, while the AfD came in second with about 20.8%. 

The coalition agreement, titled "Responsibility for Germany," was formalized in April 2025 after weeks of negotiations and is 146 pages long, outlining priorities for the next four years of governance. The new government was sworn in around May 6, 2025, about two and a half months after the election.

## CDU's Current Position on the AfD

The CDU has maintained its longstanding position of refusing to cooperate with the AfD. During the formation of the current government, Friedrich Merz explicitly rejected governing with the AfD, stating that the AfD leaders "want the opposite of what we want, and therefore it is not possible to govern with them".

When forming the current government, the CDU chose to partner with the SPD rather than consider cooperation with the AfD, despite the fact that a CDU-AfD coalition would have reached 51% of seats. This decision reinforces the CDU's commitment to maintaining the "cordon sanitaire" around the AfD, consistent with their 2018 and 2020 declarations that "There is no cooperation with the AfD - neither in direct nor indirect form."

## Factors Supporting Continued Rejection of the AfD

Several factors suggest the CDU will likely maintain its stance against the AfD:

1. **Institutional Commitment**: The CDU's position prohibiting cooperation with the AfD appears to be deeply institutionalized within the party's values and identity.

2. **Democratic Values**: The CDU continues to view the AfD as a party with positions that conflict with democratic principles, making cooperation politically and ethically problematic.

3. **International Relations**: A coalition with the AfD could damage Germany's standing in the EU and internationally, particularly given the AfD's perceived positions on European integration and foreign policy.

4. **Recent Coalition Choices**: The CDU chose to form a coalition with the SPD in 2025 despite potential policy differences, demonstrating a preference for mainstream partnerships over alternatives.

5. **Historical Precedent and Party Identity**: The CDU has consistently maintained its position against cooperation with the AfD since 2018. This stance has become part of the party's identity and a key differentiator from more right-wing positions.

## Factors That Could Drive Change

However, there are factors that could potentially shift the CDU's position:

1. **Electoral Pressure**: Recent polling has shown the AfD reaching 24% support, on par with the CDU/CSU in some polls. If this trend continues or strengthens, it could create mathematical realities that make governance without AfD cooperation increasingly difficult.

2. **Coalition Mathematical Challenges**: The CDU and SPD together only reached 43% in recent polling, insufficient for a parliamentary majority. This mathematical challenge could intensify if electoral trends continue.

3. **Regional Precedents**: If regional CDU branches begin successful cooperations with the AfD at the state level, this could create pressure for a change in the federal stance.

4. **AfD Moderation**: If the AfD were to moderate some of its most controversial positions, particularly regarding immigration and European integration, it could potentially become a more acceptable partner.

5. **Leadership Changes**: Changes in CDU leadership could bring individuals more open to pragmatic coalition considerations for political power.

## Analysis of Likelihood

The weight of evidence strongly favors continuity of the CDU's position against AfD cooperation. The party has recently had the opportunity to change course during the 2025 coalition formation but instead reaffirmed its stance. The CDU has demonstrated preference for more difficult coalitions with mainstream parties over the mathematically easier option of partnering with the AfD.

While electoral pressures exist and may increase, they have not yet reached a tipping point that would force the CDU to reconsider its fundamental position. The "cordon sanitaire" around the AfD appears to remain strong across most of the German political spectrum.

Germany's political history shows that cordon sanitaire approaches can erode over time, as seen with other parties that faced initial isolation. However, the historical context of the AfD's positions and Germany's post-war commitment to certain democratic values creates a higher barrier.

The risks to the CDU's brand, international standing, and internal cohesion from an AfD partnership likely outweigh the potential electoral benefits. Additionally, policy adjustments on topics like migration might allow the CDU to address some voter concerns that have driven AfD support without needing to partner with them.

For a reversal of the CDU's position before 2030, there would need to be a major and sustained shift in the AfD's positioning, CDU leadership and membership attitudes, and/or the overall political system. While not impossible given the 4.5-year timeframe until 2030, such a fundamental reversal would require extraordinary circumstances that are not clearly evident in current political trends.
