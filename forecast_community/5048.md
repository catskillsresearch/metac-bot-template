# Will the United Kingdom rejoin the European Union before 2030?

The question of whether the UK will rejoin the EU before 2030 requires careful analysis of current political, economic, and procedural factors shaping UK-EU relations.

## Current State of UK-EU Relations

As of June 2025, the UK and EU have entered a new phase in their post-Brexit relationship. The Labour government that came to power in 2024 pledged a "reset" in relations, which has materialized through several significant developments:

- On May 19, 2025, the UK and EU held their first summit in London since Brexit, resulting in three key documents: a Joint Statement, a Security and Defence Partnership, and a Common Understanding on cooperation
- The agreements include participation in the EU's internal electricity market, improved arrangements for British travelers, and reduced bureaucracy for British businesses exporting to the EU
- The UK has agreed to rejoin the Erasmus+ programme, with specific terms to be determined, signaling closer educational and youth cooperation
- Extended EU access to British fishing waters until 2038
- Plans for a youth mobility scheme to facilitate work, studies, and travel for young people

However, these agreements explicitly maintain the UK's position outside the EU's single market and customs union, and do not restore freedom of movement. The government has stressed that the reset is "not about renegotiating or relitigating Brexit," and it is not seeking to rejoin the EU single market or customs union.

## Political Landscape and Will

The political will for rejoining is notably absent among the UK's major parties:

- The Labour government, while much warmer toward the EU than its Conservative predecessor, has explicitly not committed to rejoining
- The Conservative Party and Reform UK maintain positions against rejoining
- Only smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP, and Plaid Cymru advocate for rejoining
- The Prime Minister has made it clear that the UK Government have ruled out the possibility of rejoining the European Union

An All-Party Parliamentary Group on Europe was established in October 2024 to promote closer ties with the EU, but this falls short of advocating full membership.

## Procedural Requirements and Timeline

Rejoining the EU would require a complex, multi-stage process:

- The UK would need to apply under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union
- Applications require unanimous approval from all 27 EU member states after consulting the European Commission and receiving consent from the European Parliament
- The EU has established criteria requiring stable institutions, a functioning market economy, and the ability to implement EU obligations
- Any concessions sought when joining would need unanimous support from member states

Even under optimal conditions, this process would take several years:
- Application and negotiations: 2-5 years
- Ratification by all member states: 1-2 years
- Implementation period: Potentially 1-2 years

Working backward from December 2029, the UK would need to formally apply by 2026-2027 at the latest for any realistic chance of rejoining before 2030.

## Public Opinion and Feasibility

For rejoining to become politically viable, there would need to be:

- Sustained strong public support (likely well above 60%)
- A UK government willing to make it a priority
- Favorable terms from the EU
- Willingness to accept potentially stricter conditions than before

While public opinion surveys show overall support for rejoining the EU, there is no evidence that this is a salient issue driving political decision-making. The EU does not feature among top public concerns.

## Potential Scenarios

**Most Likely Scenario: Continued Partnership Without Membership**
The UK continues to develop its relationship with the EU through bilateral agreements, focusing on practical cooperation in trade, defense, energy, mobility, and security, but never initiates formal reaccession proceedings. The complex accession process and political hurdles prevent rejoining even as relations continue to warm.

**Less Likely Scenario: Rejoining Before 2030**
A dramatic political shift occurs, with overwhelming public support emerging for rejoining. This leads to a formal application process, with the EU offering favorable terms and an accelerated timeline. All EU member states unanimously approve the application, and the necessary legal procedures proceed with unprecedented speed, allowing an accession treaty to come into force before 2030.

## Key Factors Weighing Against Rejoining by 2030

1. **Explicit Current Policy**: The UK government has repeatedly stated it is not seeking to rejoin the single market, customs union, or restore freedom of movement
2. **Political Consensus**: No major UK political party has a manifesto commitment to rejoin the EU
3. **Procedural Timeline**: The accession process typically takes many years, and the window until 2030 is relatively narrow
4. **Membership Terms**: Any new membership would likely require accepting less favorable terms than before, potentially including requirements to join the euro and Schengen Area
5. **EU Receptiveness**: While the EU is open to closer ties, there is no indication of special fast-track provisions for a returning UK

## Key Factors That Could Support Rejoining

1. **Improved Relations**: The significant reset in UK-EU relations provides a foundation for potential deeper integration
2. **Economic Pressures**: Issues such as the EU's carbon border tax (estimated at £800 million annually for UK companies) create incentives for closer alignment
3. **Security Concerns**: Geopolitical threats push the UK and EU toward deeper security cooperation
4. **Incremental Integration**: The pattern of sector-by-sector cooperation could eventually build momentum toward full membership

The current trajectory suggests the UK is pursuing a "third way" approach – neither full separation nor rejoining, but rather a strategic partnership with closer cooperation in specific areas. This represents a pragmatic middle ground focused on maximizing practical benefits while maintaining independence from EU institutions.

The UK's most recent agreement to rejoin the Erasmus+ programme demonstrates willingness for selective participation in EU initiatives, but falls significantly short of the comprehensive integration that full EU membership would entail.
