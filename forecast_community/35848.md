(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
There are approximately 4.5 months remaining until October 1, 2025, the resolution deadline for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
If Congress takes no action, the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)—including lower tax rates, higher standard deduction, expanded Child Tax Credit, and higher estate/gift tax exclusion—will expire at the end of 2025. This means tax brackets will revert, the standard deduction will be cut, and other provisions will roll back to pre-TCJA law[1][4][5]. Under these conditions, the outcome would resolve as **No**.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
A No outcome occurs if October 1, 2025, arrives without any reconciliation bill extending these provisions using a "current policy" baseline, or if both a revenue and a spending reconciliation bill are enacted before such an extension. This would be the most likely result under current Senate rules, given the lack of precedent for using the "current policy" baseline, the procedural hurdles (especially with the Senate parliamentarian), and if bipartisan tensions prevent a permanent extension[1][3][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome requires that, before October 1, 2025, at least one of the major TCJA individual tax cuts is extended by a Senate reconciliation bill that uses a "current policy" baseline—i.e., one that treats the tax cuts as having already been extended for scoring purposes. This would likely require either a favorable procedural ruling or an override of Senate precedent, plus enough political discipline within the Republican caucus to pass such a bill over Democratic objections[1].

## Rationale

**Current Situation (as of May 2025):**  
- There is bipartisan and public pressure to address the expiring TCJA provisions, particularly as neither party wants to see broad tax hikes on middle- and lower-income households[3].  
- Congressional Republicans are actively pushing for an extension, with the House and Senate pursuing different approaches to offsets and permanence[1].  
- The "current policy" baseline, which would score an extension as having no substantial cost, is being promoted by Senate Republicans but is seen by critics (including budget experts and Democrats) as a budget "gimmick" and lacks precedent in Senate reconciliation[1][3][4].  
- The traditional "current law" baseline assumes all tax cuts expire, scoring their extension as a $4 trillion cost, which makes passage under reconciliation rules (which prohibit increasing the long-term deficit) much harder[1][3][5].

**Key Uncertainties:**  
- The procedural ruling from the Senate parliamentarian on whether the "current policy" baseline can be used in reconciliation remains unavailable as of this date; no public confirmation or precedent allows it[1][5].  
- Internal divisions within the majority party (especially on Medicaid cuts or SALT provisions), and between House and Senate, complicate the legislative path[1].  
- The legislative window is narrow, and final action is still pending despite House movement on draft bills[1].

**Reasoning on Likelihood:**  
- The weight of history and Senate procedure favors a "current law" baseline. Budget experts widely expect the parliamentarian to reject the "current policy" baseline[1][3][5].  
- No reconciliation bill using a "current policy" baseline has ever been enacted, and the risks of overriding the parliamentarian (or abolishing the filibuster) are high and divisive[1].  
- Even as political and lobbying pressure mounts, and some House and business voices demand the permanent extension, credible reporting does not indicate a consensus or procedural breakthrough in the Senate[1][3].  
- The default (status quo) is that expiration occurs if Congress does not act, which remains the most likely outcome in the face of gridlock or procedural roadblocks[1][5].

**That said, the probability of a parliamentary or political breakthrough is not zero:**  
- Republicans are actively and publicly pushing the issue; budget resolutions and committee drafts signal intent, and a surprise ruling or aggressive political action could change the outcome late in the game[1][3].  
- If Republicans hold or strengthen Senate control and unify behind a reconciliation package—potentially with concessions or headline provisions—they could attempt to override precedent[1].

Given all of this, a cautious probabilistic assessment should overweight the default (No) but allow for the real, if historically small, probability of a Yes outcome due to unprecedented political or procedural action.
