# TCJA Extension Outlook: Reconciliation with a Current Policy Baseline

As the December 31, 2025 expiration date for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) individual provisions approaches, Congress faces critical decisions about extending these tax cuts. The central question is whether Republicans will successfully use Senate reconciliation with a "current policy" baseline to extend key TCJA provisions before October 1, 2025.

## The Current Policy Baseline Approach

The distinction between baseline approaches is crucial for the TCJA extension:

- **Current law baseline:** Assumes TCJA provisions expire as scheduled, making extensions appear as new tax cuts with significant deficit impact ($4-5 trillion over 10 years)
- **Current policy baseline:** Assumes TCJA provisions continue, making extensions appear budget-neutral

Republicans have included the current policy baseline approach in their budget resolution passed by both chambers. This unprecedented approach would allow them to make permanent tax changes without violating the Senate's Byrd Rule, which prohibits reconciliation provisions that increase deficits beyond the 10-year budget window.

## Current Status of Extension Efforts

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included significant individual tax provisions set to expire on December 31, 2025. These include:

- Lower tax rates across brackets
- Nearly doubled standard deduction
- Expanded Child Tax Credits
- Higher estate tax exemptions

Without congressional action, over 62% of tax filers would experience tax increases in 2026. As of May 2025, both chambers of Congress are actively working on legislation to address these expiring provisions.

The House Ways and Means Committee has released partial text for the tax portion of a reconciliation bill aimed at extending the TCJA provisions, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating these provisions would add over $4.9 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.

## Key Factors Affecting the Outcome

### Parliamentary Considerations

The Senate parliamentarian has not yet ruled on whether a current policy baseline can be used in reconciliation. This is a novel approach without clear precedent. The parliamentarian's ruling will be pivotal, as it determines whether Republicans can use this mechanism to achieve permanent extensions.

### Political Dynamics

Republicans have expressed strong intent to use reconciliation to extend the TCJA provisions. The House has already begun advancing legislation using this approach. However, there are divisions within Republican ranks:

- House Republicans favor a $4.5 trillion extension package
- Senate Republicans prefer making the tax cuts permanent using the current policy baseline
- Some moderate Republicans and deficit hawks have concerns about the impact on the federal debt

### Internal Party Divisions

There are significant divisions within the Republican Party over specific elements:

- Some Republicans support raising the top marginal tax rate to 39.6% for high-income individuals to help offset costs
- Deep divisions exist over proposed Medicaid cuts to help pay for the tax cuts
- The state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap is another point of contention, with representatives from high-tax states demanding changes

## Potential Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Use of Current Policy Baseline

Republicans successfully convince the Senate parliamentarian to allow a current policy baseline for reconciliation, enabling them to pass permanent extensions of key TCJA individual tax provisions without being constrained by the Byrd Rule's prohibition on increasing deficits outside the budget window.

### Scenario 2: Parliamentary Rejection

The Senate Parliamentarian rejects the use of a "current policy" baseline in reconciliation, forcing Republicans to either:
- Use a traditional current law baseline (making permanent extension difficult due to deficit implications)
- Pursue a short-term extension
- Find significant offsets to make permanent extensions viable

### Scenario 3: Compromise Approaches

Given the political complexities, several compromise approaches could emerge:

1. **Selective extensions:** Extending most TCJA provisions but allowing the top rate to revert to 39.6% for high earners
2. **Modified extensions:** Creating new tax brackets at higher income thresholds
3. **Short-term extensions:** Extending provisions for 1-2 years to allow further negotiation

## Timeline and Pressure

With just over four months until October 1, 2025, and seven months until the TCJA provisions expire, there is increasing urgency to act. Republicans initially aimed to have a final budget reconciliation package on the President's desk by Memorial Day 2025, but this timeline has already slipped.

Despite the delays, the reconciliation process has already begun, with concrete legislative text being drafted and moving through committee. This indicates momentum toward attempting to use the current policy baseline approach.

## Historical Context

There is no clear precedent for using a current policy baseline in reconciliation, making approval uncertain. However, there is precedent for Congress addressing expiring tax provisions. In 2012, a series of tax cuts enacted by George W. Bush were extended through bipartisan agreement, and in 2010, a short-term extension was passed when the government was divided following midterm elections.

The status quo tends to persist and major legislative changes often face unexpected obstacles. However, in this case, there are strong political incentives to act before the TCJA expires, and concrete steps have already been taken toward using the current policy baseline approach.

## Weighing the Factors

Several factors increase the likelihood of success:
- Republican control of both chambers of Congress
- Strong political incentives to extend tax cuts before expiration
- Business community support (nearly 500 business organizations have urged Congress to adopt this approach)
- Budget resolution using current policy baseline already passed

Factors decreasing the likelihood:
- Unprecedented nature of the current policy baseline in reconciliation
- Pending Senate Parliamentarian ruling
- Internal Republican divisions on specific provisions and offsets
- Slipping timeline and procedural complexity

The outcome largely depends on whether Republicans can maintain unity and navigate procedural hurdles, particularly the critical ruling from the Senate Parliamentarian on the validity of using a current policy baseline in reconciliation.
