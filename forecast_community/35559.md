(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
The first round of the Polish presidential election will be held on May 18, 2025. If no candidate secures more than 50% of the vote, a second-round runoff between the top two candidates will take place on June 1, 2025. This means the final outcome will be known in approximately three weeks[4][5].

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Rafał Trzaskowski currently leads in the polls with support consistently above 30%—estimates range from 33.2% to 38.3%—with his main opponent, Karol Nawrocki, polling in the mid-20s. No candidate is on track to win outright in the first round, making a runoff likely. If voting patterns hold and transfers from eliminated candidates do not decisively favor Nawrocki, Trzaskowski would be slightly favored to win in the second round[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
Karol Nawrocki, or another non-Trzaskowski candidate, overtakes Trzaskowski in the runoff. This could happen if right-leaning and undecided voters, as well as those supporting third-place candidate Sławomir Mentzen (and others), coalesce behind Nawrocki, shifting the balance in the second round. Additionally, a drop in urban (pro-Trzaskowski) turnout or a major campaign misstep could lead to a Nawrocki victory[3][5].

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
Trzaskowski maintains his current lead and successfully secures enough support from voters of eliminated candidates (e.g., Hołownia, Biejat) in the runoff, particularly among centrist and left-leaning segments. High urban turnout and continued consolidation of pro-EU, liberal voters would enable Trzaskowski to be officially declared president-elect[1][2][5].

## Rationale

- **Current polling averages** suggest Trzaskowski would comfortably advance to the runoff and remains the slight favorite, but the race has become more competitive as Nawrocki has narrowed the gap in recent weeks[1][2][3][5].
- **Runoff dynamics** will be critical. While Trzaskowski benefits from being the ruling party's candidate and has strong urban and liberal support, the consolidation of right-wing and anti-establishment voters could tip the balance to Nawrocki, especially given the unpredictable nature of second-round vote transfers[5].
- **Recent trends** favor a tightening race, which increases uncertainty. However, the institutional and political context has shifted toward the Civic Coalition since their 2023 and 2024 victories, and the desire for alignment with the Tusk government may help Trzaskowski in the decisive round[1][2][5].
- **Status quo bias** in forecasting suggests maintaining current poll leader as slight favorite, barring disruptive last-minute developments.

## Final Assessment

Probability: **65%**

This estimate reflects Trzaskowski's slight but not overwhelming advantage, the high volatility of the race, and the crucial role of second-round dynamics and coalition-building.
