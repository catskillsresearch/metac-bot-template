(a) **Time Left Until Outcome Known:**  
There are a little over seven months until the end of 2025, at which point the question resolves. Any confirmed possession or credible reporting of an Iranian nuclear weapon before January 1, 2026, would satisfy the criteria.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Iran remains a nuclear threshold state. As of May 2025, Iran has not publicly declared, tested, or been credibly reported by authoritative sources (Arms Control Association, SIPRI, FAS) to possess a nuclear weapon. Iran continues to enrich uranium at high levels (up to 60%), but has not crossed to producing 90% enriched uranium or demonstrated weaponization[3][4][5].

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Iran continues its current policy of nuclear ambiguity: it steadily advances its technical capabilities and expands enrichment, but refrains from producing weapons-grade uranium (90%+), assembling a weapon, performing a test, or publicly declaring possession. Ongoing diplomatic efforts, threat of military action, and commitment to the Supreme Leader’s fatwa against nuclear weapons deter an overt weapons program. There is no credible reporting or acknowledgment by the designated authorities that Iran possesses a nuclear weapon by the end of 2025.

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
A major geopolitical or security shock (such as regional conflict escalation, collapse of negotiations, or regime instability) prompts Iran’s leadership to make a rapid dash for the bomb. Iran would need to enrich its 60% uranium stockpile to weapons grade, assemble and possibly test a device or publicly declare possession. This would need to be confirmed by either Iranian admission deemed credible, a nuclear test, or a report by the Arms Control Association, SIPRI, or FAS before January 2026.

## Rationale

Iran has dramatically improved its technical capability to produce weapons-grade uranium quickly, with sufficient stockpiles and advanced centrifuges at protected sites like Fordow[3][4][5]. Its estimated breakout time to produce enough fissile material for a bomb is now less than two weeks[5]. However, no evidence indicates that Iran has begun weaponization or enrichment to 90%[4][5]. 

Senior Iranian leadership, including the president, consistently and repeatedly assert Iran does not seek nuclear weapons and is committed to a peaceful nuclear program[3]. The Supreme Leader’s 2005 fatwa against nuclear weapons remains an official position, though there are reports of internal pressure to lift it in light of regional insecurity[2].

Meanwhile, the international response—particularly the US and Israel—remains highly attentive, signaling low tolerance for crossing key red lines. Any overt move toward weaponization would almost certainly be detected, triggering strong responses, possibly including military intervention or sabotage[1][3].

The most likely pathway to a "Yes" outcome is a severe crisis in which Iranian leaders feel existentially threatened and calculate that only open possession of a nuclear weapon will ensure regime survival. While technically possible within the timeframe, this would require a dramatic, observable policy shift, which would be highly risky and is not currently indicated by either Iranian rhetoric or intelligence assessments.

Historically, the pace of change on nuclear proliferation issues is slow and punctuated by visible, deliberate signals rather than rapid, secret breakthroughs. Given the high stakes and international scrutiny, inertia favors the status quo—continued nuclear advances and brinkmanship, but no overt weaponization or credible confirmation of such before 2026.
