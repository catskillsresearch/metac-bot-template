The geopolitical landscape over the next 15 years suggests that a direct Russian invasion of a NATO member is highly unlikely. Historically, since NATO's founding in 1949, there have been no instances of Russian or Soviet invasions of NATO territory. This historical precedent, combined with the current geopolitical environment, supports the continuation of this trend. 

NATO has significantly bolstered its defenses along its eastern flank, maintaining a strong deterrent posture. This increased military readiness, coupled with diplomatic efforts, serves to prevent escalation into direct conflict with NATO members. Russia, on the other hand, remains constrained by its military commitments, particularly in Ukraine, and faces ongoing economic challenges. These factors limit Russia's capacity for new large-scale offensives and deter aggressive military actions against NATO.

While there are potential risks, such as a significant geopolitical shift or a drastic change in Russian leadership that could lead to aggressive expansionist actions, these scenarios are less likely given the high costs and risks associated with a direct confrontation with NATO. Additionally, any perceived opportunity due to weakened NATO cohesion or miscalculations in international relations would still face the formidable deterrence provided by NATO's unity and military capabilities.

Overall, the current trends and historical context heavily favor the status quo outcome, where Russia refrains from direct military aggression against NATO members. The probability of Bryan Caplan winning his bet remains high, as the geopolitical and military dynamics continue to support a stable and deterrent environment.
