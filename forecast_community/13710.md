Democratic nations have long demonstrated a tendency to resolve disputes through diplomatic, economic, and institutional means rather than military confrontation. The historical record of democratic peace suggests that established democratic states—whether categorized as full or even somewhat flawed—generally adhere to norms and practices that favor conflict management over escalation. In many cases, robust institutions, stable checks and balances, and long-standing multilateral alliances such as NATO or the EU provide a strong framework that mitigates disputes even when tensions or crises emerge.

At the same time, certain dynamics could potentially disrupt this peace. Unforeseen systemic shocks—including severe economic crises, rapid or sustained democratic backsliding, or a breakdown in established norms—could unmoor the traditional equilibrium. If key democratic players were to experience rapid institutional degradation or if miscalculations under conditions of heightened nationalistic fervor and regional tensions led to significant shifts in alliance structures, the risk of conflict might be heightened. However, such scenarios require multiple, significant deviations from the gradual, incremental changes that have characterized democratic evolution over decades.

Overall, while future uncertainties cannot be entirely dismissed, the enduring stability of democratic norms, combined with economic interdependence and the historical effectiveness of peaceful conflict resolution, strongly supports the view that democracies are likely to continue resolving their differences without resorting to war.
