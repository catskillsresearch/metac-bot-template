## Combined Rationale

The prospect of 2025 becoming the warmest year on record globally, according to the ECMWF, hinges on a complex interplay of ongoing climate trends, the influence of natural variability (especially La Niña), and the possibility of unprecedented anomalous warmth in the remaining months.

2025 opened with exceptional heat: January was the warmest on record globally, reaching 1.75°C above pre-industrial levels, notably surpassing January 2024 despite the presence of La Niña, which typically exerts a cooling influence on global temperatures. This remarkable start underscores the persistence and intensity of the current warming trend, characterized by frequent records in recent years, and follows the streak of 2023 and 2024, both of which were exceptionally hot years.

However, by April, the temperature trajectory had moderated somewhat. April 2025 was the second-warmest April on record, not the warmest, with first-quarter data placing 2025 as the second warmest year-to-date—closely behind 2024, but not ahead. This pattern suggests that, while 2025 remains on an exceptionally warm path, it has not consistently outpaced last year’s record-setting temperatures. The year-to-date trend aligns with projections by Carbon Brief, which, analyzing the relationship between early-year and annual temperatures since 1970, concludes that 2025 is virtually certain to be within the top three warmest years, with a best estimate approximately equal to 2023 but a bit below 2024. Other analyses such as those from Berkeley Earth similarly estimate about a one-in-three (34%) chance of breaking the 2024 record.

A significant factor is the development and expected persistence of La Niña conditions through the remainder of the year. Historically, La Niña periods have led to slight cooling, moderating global temperature increases after El Niño peaks. This effect is evident in forecasts and model projections, which, despite recent record-breaking anomalies, generally anticipate that the cooling influence of La Niña will prevent 2025 from consistently exceeding the monthly and annual averages set in 2024. The likelihood of 2025 becoming the warmest year would increase if La Niña's moderating effect is weaker than expected or if other climate feedbacks—such as continued record ocean warmth, persistent low sea ice, or extreme regional heatwaves—push global averages beyond current model projections.

Nevertheless, climate change's overarching trend of rising greenhouse gas concentrations continues to drive exceptional warmth, and the climate system has shown a capacity for surprises, occasionally exceeding statistical expectations. Still, the weight of evidence favors the status quo outcome, where 2025 follows the established ranking, finishing as one of the top three warmest years on record but not surpassing 2024 unless there is an unforeseen and sustained escalation in anomalous warmth across multiple months.

In summary, while there is a non-trivial risk that 2025 could become the new warmest year—particularly if novel or extreme climate anomalies arise—the best-supported scenario, according to current projections and expert consensus, is that 2025 will be extremely warm but will likely fall just short of setting a new global temperature record according to ECMWF data.
