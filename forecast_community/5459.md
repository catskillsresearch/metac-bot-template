The potential rescheduling of psilocybin from its current Schedule I status before 2036 is influenced by several key factors that suggest a shift in policy is increasingly likely.

First, the FDA's "breakthrough therapy" designation for psilocybin in treating depression signals a growing recognition of its medical potential at the federal level. This designation could accelerate the approval process for psilocybin-based treatments, paving the way for rescheduling.

Second, there is increasing state-level activity around psilocybin reform. Multiple states are considering or implementing changes to their laws regarding psilocybin, creating a groundswell of support for federal action.

Third, a growing body of research continues to demonstrate psilocybin's therapeutic benefits for various mental health conditions. As clinical trials progress and yield positive results, the scientific case for rescheduling strengthens.

Fourth, public opinion is shifting, with reduced stigma around psychedelics and increased acceptance of their potential therapeutic uses. This changing sentiment could translate into political pressure for reform.

Fifth, the precedent set by cannabis reforms provides a potential roadmap for psilocybin. However, psilocybin appears to have a clearer pharmaceutical development pathway, which could expedite its rescheduling process.

Despite these promising indicators, significant hurdles remain. Federal rescheduling requires either an act of Congress or an administrative process following FDA approval, both of which can be time-consuming. Political resistance within the DEA or Congress could slow or block rescheduling efforts. Additionally, the timeline for FDA approval depends on ongoing clinical trials, which could face delays or setbacks.

The 10-year timeframe until 2036 provides a substantial window for these changes to occur, allowing for gradual policy shifts and the completion of necessary research and regulatory processes. The accelerating pace of research and state-level reforms, combined with the potential for FDA approval of psilocybin-based treatments, make rescheduling before 2036 more likely than not.

While the status quo typically has inertia, especially in drug policy, the accumulating evidence and policy shifts suggest that change is probable in this case. However, given the long timeframe and potential for unforeseen developments, it's important to maintain a balanced perspective on the likelihood of rescheduling.
