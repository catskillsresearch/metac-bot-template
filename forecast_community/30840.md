(a) Time until outcome: ~7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)
(b) Status quo outcome: Yes - Proposition 12 remains in effect
(c) No scenario: The Food Security and Farm Protection Act passes Congress and is signed into law before January 2026, nullifying California's ability to enforce Proposition 12
(d) Yes scenario: Legislative efforts to overturn Proposition 12 fail to pass Congress or are vetoed, allowing the law to remain fully in effect

California's Proposition 12, the "Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act," is currently a fully implemented law in the state. To forecast whether it will remain in effect on January 1, 2026, I need to evaluate the current status of the law, ongoing challenges, and potential pathways for change.

## Current Status of Proposition 12

Proposition 12 became fully effective on January 1, 2024, following a significant legal challenge that reached the Supreme Court[1]. The law establishes the state's Animal Care Program and requires third-party certification for producers[1]. Under Proposition 12, all pork producers must be registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)[1]. The law sets specific space requirements for farm animals and prohibits the sale of products in California from animals confined in non-compliant conditions, regardless of where they were raised[4].

The Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12's constitutionality in 2023, rejecting arguments that it violated the dormant Commerce Clause[3][5]. This ruling was significant, as the pork industry had pursued multiple legal challenges, ultimately losing 12 straight cases in federal courts[5]. The egg industry and veal industry have generally accepted and supported the standards, while the pork industry has remained opposed[5].

## Current Challenges to the Law

Despite being upheld by the Supreme Court, Proposition 12 faces significant legislative challenges:

1. **Federal Legislative Efforts**: The Food Security and Farm Protection Act (S. 1326) has been introduced in the Senate, which would create a private right of action to invalidate state agricultural regulations that affect interstate commerce[1]. This bill specifically targets laws like Proposition 12.

2. **Farm Bill Provisions**: House Republicans are attempting to include provisions in the Farm Bill that would prevent states from imposing production standards on products not physically raised in that state[1].

3. **Political Support for Repeal**: Current USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has expressed concerns about "chaos in the marketplace" without federal action[1]. Additionally, Trump's nominee for Agriculture Secretary, Brooke Rollins, has explicitly stated she would work to repeal Proposition 12[1].

## Market Impact and Industry Pressure

Implementation of Proposition 12 has had significant economic effects:

- Pork prices in California have reportedly increased substantially since implementation[1].
- California's consumption of fresh pork has decreased from approximately 13% to 10% of U.S. production in just one year[1].
- California produces only a tiny fraction of the nation's hogs while consuming about 10% of U.S. pork production[1].

These economic impacts create pressure from consumers and industry to reconsider or modify the law.

## Factors Supporting Proposition 12's Continuation

Several factors support Proposition 12 remaining in effect:

1. **Current Legal Status**: The law has already survived significant legal challenges, including at the Supreme Court level[3][5].

2. **Strong Public Support**: Proposition 12 was approved by 63% of California voters, indicating substantial public backing[5].

3. **State Sovereignty Principles**: California has a history of defending its state laws against federal interference.

4. **Implementation Progress**: The law is already fully implemented, with compliance systems in place[1].

## Forecasting Analysis

When forecasting, I need to consider both the status quo (Proposition 12 remaining in effect) and the pathways to change (federal legislation overriding it).

The most likely path to Proposition 12 being nullified would be through federal legislation like the Food Security and Farm Protection Act. For this to happen before January 1, 2026:

1. The legislation would need to pass both houses of Congress
2. It would need to be signed into law by the President
3. It would need to withstand potential legal challenges

Given the relatively short timeframe (7.5 months), the complexities of the legislative process, and the fact that similar efforts have failed in the past, there are significant obstacles to this occurring. Federal legislation moves slowly, especially on contentious issues.

However, there is clearly organized opposition to Proposition 12, with industry groups, some lawmakers, and even the USDA Secretary expressing concerns about its effects. The economic impacts are creating pressure for change.

Taking into account the status quo bias (that laws, once implemented, tend to remain in effect), the Supreme Court's validation of the law, the challenges of passing federal legislation in a limited timeframe, but also recognizing the significant organized opposition, I believe Proposition 12 is more likely than not to remain in effect on January 1, 2026.

Probability: 65%
