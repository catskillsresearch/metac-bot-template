The current environment suggests that the 30‐year fixed mortgage rate is likely to remain within a very narrow band between about 6.8% and 6.9% as we approach the target date. In a scenario where prevailing economic conditions persist—with inflation remaining relatively stable and market expectations intact—the status quo estimate would hold near 6.85%, while a continuation of current trends points to a central outcome in the mid- to upper-6.80% range.

However, several factors could induce deviations from this central tendency. Should inflation unexpectedly ease and the Federal Reserve signal a faster pace of policy easing, improved bond yields could exert downward pressure, nudging the rate to approximately 6.80%. On the other hand, a resurgence of inflationary pressures, concerns about fiscal deficits, or renewed uncertainties—such as escalating tariff disputes or shifts in market sentiment regarding bond yields—could push the rate toward the upper limits of the range, potentially nearing 6.9% or slightly above. Overall, while expert consensus and current trends favor a relatively stable outcome, slight deviations on either side remain plausible depending on how these economic and policy factors evolve.
