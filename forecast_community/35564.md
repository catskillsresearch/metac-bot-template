(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Final global box office data for 2025 will not be confirmed until early 2026, so there are just under eight months remaining until the outcome can be resolved with certainty.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 2025, Ne Zha 2 is the highest-grossing film worldwide, grossing over $2.1 billion[1][3]. Ne Zha 2 is a sequel and thus unequivocally part of a franchise[3]. If nothing changes, the answer is **Yes**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
For a No outcome, a non-franchise film released later in 2025 would have to gross more than Ne Zha 2's $2.1 billion worldwide total[3]. This would require an original film (not a sequel, remake, or in a shared universe, and without an announced sequel) to achieve historic box office success—an outcome without clear precedent this decade.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
The most likely scenario is that Ne Zha 2 remains the top-grossing film, or another franchise title scheduled for release (such as Avatar: Fire and Ash, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, or Jurassic World Rebirth) overtakes it—since all of these are franchise entries, any plausible overtake still results in a Yes[2][3].

## Rationale

- Franchise films have dominated the global box office, with three of the last four years' top films coming from established series[5].
- As of early May, every leading 2025 box office film is part of a franchise. Ne Zha 2’s revenue lead is especially pronounced, and no standalone, non-franchise film is close in earnings[1][3].
- While it is theoretically possible for an original film to launch and earn over $2.1 billion, the historical record shows this is extremely unlikely, especially with several major franchise films still ahead in the release schedule and none of the original films currently in contention[3].
- The dominance of franchise films in both global box office and pop culture remains unchallenged, and no industry trends suggest a sudden reversal within the remaining months of 2025[5].

Probability estimates must heavily weight the status quo given the slow movement of box office trends. The combination of Ne Zha 2’s strong lead and the anticipated performance of upcoming franchise films makes a franchise-topping outcome overwhelmingly likely.

**Probability: 98%**
