Laurent Gbagbo, former president of Côte d’Ivoire, is currently disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election due to a prior criminal conviction related to the 2010–2011 post-election crisis. This exclusion has been confirmed by multiple international news organizations and is documented in both official provisional lists and independent reporting as of late May 2025. Gbagbo’s disqualification has triggered significant legal and political appeals, as well as mobilization by his supporters, but there is no credible or authoritative evidence suggesting that his exclusion is close to being reversed before the July 1 deadline. While domestic and international pressure for his reinstatement exists, the appeals process in the Ivorian context has historically been lengthy and rarely results in rapid or last-minute reinstatements, especially for high-profile opposition figures in a charged political environment.

The other specified candidates—Gnangbo Kacou, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo—remain eligible and have not been reported as disqualified or at imminent risk of exclusion from the electoral list as of the current date. The political and legal situation surrounding their candidacies is stable, with no credible reports or indicators suggesting that new disqualifications are likely in the short remaining period.

Given the nature of Ivorian election law, recent procedural history, and the tight timeline remaining until July 1, the status quo is highly likely to persist: Gbagbo will remain excluded, satisfying the criteria that at least one candidate is disqualified before the cutoff date. The probability of a sudden reversal—while not strictly zero—is low, due to both procedural complexity and the lack of tangible progress in the current appeals.

Therefore, under the current legal, administrative, and political circumstances, and based on robust recent reporting and the official status of the candidates, at least one named candidate—Laurent Gbagbo—remains disqualified as of late May 2025. Unless exceptional and rapid developments occur, this disqualification will stand through July 1, 2025.
