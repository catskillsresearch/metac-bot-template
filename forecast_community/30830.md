As a professional forecaster, I'll assess whether Donald Trump will have a positive net favorability rating on December 20, 2025, according to 538.

(a) Time until outcome: 7 months, 7 days from today (May 13, 2025 to December 20, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Current net favorability is negative. According to recent data, Trump's approval rating shows a net negative of approximately -5 points, with various polls showing figures between -4.8% and -8.5% since early April 2025.

(c) No outcome scenario: Trump continues to implement controversial policies like tariffs and mass deportations, facing international criticism and domestic economic challenges. His combative style alienates moderates and independents, while opposition solidifies. The honeymoon period continues to fade, and his net favorability remains negative through December 2025.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Trump's economic and immigration policies begin showing positive results, with improved economic indicators and perceived security gains. International tensions ease through successful negotiations. His rhetoric moderates, appealing to centrists while maintaining his base. Approval ratings steadily climb through fall 2025, reaching net positive territory by December.

Based on the available data and historical patterns, I'll now provide my analysis:

Trump's current net favorability and approval ratings are showing a mixed but predominantly negative picture. After an initial post-inauguration "honeymoon" period where he briefly reached positive territory in January-February 2025, his ratings have declined again, settling into negative territory by April-May 2025.

## Historical Context

During Trump's first term, he rarely achieved positive net favorability or approval ratings. According to FiveThirtyEight data, Trump had historically struggled to maintain positive numbers throughout his presidency. The brief positive spike after his 2024 election victory appears to be following the typical pattern of a "honeymoon period" that fades over time.

Recent polling from May 2025 shows varying results but generally indicates Trump remains underwater in approval:
- Decision Desk HQ's average shows Trump at -4.8% net approval as of May 11, 2025
- Quantus Insights shows a statistical tie (48.2% approve, 48.3% disapprove)
- Rasmussen, typically more favorable to Trump, shows him at 52% approval
- Overall polling aggregates still show him in negative territory

## Key Factors to Consider

1. **Historical Precedent**: Trump maintained negative net favorability throughout most of his first term and has already returned to negative territory after a brief honeymoon period in early 2025.

2. **Policy Implementation**: Trump's tariff policies announced in April 2025 (referred to as "Liberation Day") appear to have negatively impacted his approval, with Nate Silver noting a drop from -2.5 to -8.5 in early April.

3. **International Standing**: Recent international polling shows the U.S. reputation has deteriorated significantly since Trump's return, with negative perceptions in 82% of countries worldwide.

4. **Economic Conditions**: The economy showed signs of contraction in Q1 2025 (-0.3% GDP), and markets experienced volatility following tariff announcements. Economic performance through fall 2025 will significantly impact Trump's ratings.

5. **Partisan Polarization**: Trump maintains strong support among Republicans (net approval +51 points in recent polls) but continues to struggle with independents (net approval -35 points).

## Trend Analysis

While there was a slight improvement in approval from late April to mid-May 2025 (from -9.2% to -4.8%), this appears to be a minor correction rather than the beginning of a sustained positive trend. Trump's approval has historically fluctuated within a relatively narrow band, rarely breaking into positive territory.

The "right direction/wrong track" polling has shown some improvement, with recent Rasmussen polls showing 49% believing the country is headed in the right direction versus 46% saying wrong track. However, this hasn't translated to sustained positive personal favorability for Trump.

## Probabilistic Assessment

Given Trump's historical difficulty maintaining positive approval ratings, the already-fading honeymoon effect, international criticism of his policies, and economic headwinds, the most likely scenario is that his net favorability will remain negative through December 2025.

While there is potential for improvement through policy successes, particularly if economic conditions improve significantly in the second half of 2025, the historical pattern suggests this is less probable than continued negative ratings.

Looking at all the evidence and balancing the status quo bias with potential developments over the next seven months, I estimate there is approximately a 25% chance that Trump will have a positive net favorability rating on December 20, 2025, according to FiveThirtyEight.

Probability: 25%
