Global stock market returns over the 2022–2031 decade will be shaped by an interplay of historical patterns, current performances, sector-level growth expectations, and both upside and downside risks from macroeconomic and geopolitical developments.

The first few years of the decade have already seen global equities deliver solid nominal gains, but with much of this growth tempered by significant inflation, real returns have remained modest—likely in the low single digits on an annualized basis so far. Historical precedent suggests that, over long periods, real equity returns typically land in the 4–7% range per year, though decade-to-decade variability is high due to shifting valuations, macroeconomic cycles, and world events.

Expert and market forecasts for the remainder of the decade are mixed. Sell-side institutions and professional communities generally anticipate more moderate real returns for developed markets, often in the 2–4% range, reflecting currently elevated valuations and moderate growth prospects. However, the global index also incorporates faster-growing emerging economies and regions positioned for cyclical recovery, raising the expected return range to roughly 3–5% real per annum. Sectoral projections illustrate the breadth of underlying growth opportunities: areas like AI, green technologies, fintech, and healthcare are expected to expand at high compound rates, potentially boosting global equity performance if these trends are sustained and broadly profitable.

The outlook, however, remains defined by wide uncertainty. Downside risk scenarios could materialize from sustained high inflation (stagflation), aggressive monetary policy tightening, unresolved or escalating geopolitical conflicts, deglobalization, debt crises, or severe economic shocks—any of which could depress both nominal market performance and real returns, potentially pulling average annualized global equity returns near or below zero for the decade. Conversely, a combination of accelerated technological breakthroughs, successful climate adaptation, benign inflation, and synchronized policy support could result in unexpectedly strong growth, pushing real returns well above historical norms—especially if emerging economies realize their demographic and reform-driven growth potential.

In summary, over the 2022–2031 period, global stock market real returns are most likely to revert toward long-run historical averages but with substantial dispersion possible due to the heightened macroeconomic, technological, and geopolitical volatility of the 2020s. The main body of forecasts from institutions and experts cluster around a 3–5% annual real return, with downside risks driven by macro shocks and upside potential tied to productivity booms, stable globalization, and enduring market innovation.
