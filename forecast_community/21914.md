## Rationale for the Likelihood of Bryan Caplan Winning His Bet on Global Economic Growth

The likelihood that real gross world product (GWP) will not exceed 130% of its previous yearly peak in any single year by January 1, 2043, is overwhelmingly supported by historical precedent, mainstream forecasts, and structural features of the global economy.

**Historical Growth Patterns and Precedent**

Global economic growth has consistently followed a gradual trajectory, typically within the range of 2–4% per year. Even during extraordinary periods such as postwar recoveries or China’s rapid industrialization, there has never been a single year in which global real output exceeded a 30% increase over its prior peak. Recent projections from major international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank continue to forecast modest growth rates—generally below 4% annually—even for rapidly expanding economies. This pattern is further reinforced by the fact that large, emerging markets such as Nigeria maintain robust—but still moderate—growth rates, with Nigeria’s GDP, for example, projected to average 3.7% growth between 2023 and 2043, contingent on overcoming deep-seated infrastructure and institutional challenges.

**Technological Innovation and Its Economic Impact**

The most plausible scenario for breaching the 30% threshold within a single year would involve an unprecedented technological breakthrough, most notably the rapid development and global adoption of transformative artificial general intelligence (AGI). While community forecasts place the median arrival of such technology around 2040, even optimistic timelines acknowledge significant lags between invention and worldwide economic impact. The diffusion of technological advances into real economic output has historically been slowed by infrastructure, regulatory, and labor adaptation bottlenecks, as well as fragmented global institutions and uneven access.

**Economic Constraints and Systemic Inertia**

The global economy is characterized by substantial inertia and complexity. Structural barriers—including inadequate infrastructure, regulatory hurdles, public debt burdens, and geopolitical fragmentation—act as strong stabilizers against abrupt, large-scale changes. Such constraints are particularly relevant in key growth regions, where economic transformation is further complicated by issues like unreliable power supply and insecurity. Even converging technological advances across sectors—such as AI, energy, and biotech—are unlikely to synchronize instantaneously or be implemented at a speed sufficient to create a single-year, 30% global leap.

**Current and Projected Macroeconomic Environment**

Up-to-date macroeconomic forecasts reinforce this outlook. For example, the IMF recently downgraded its global real GDP growth forecast from 3.3% to 2.8% for 2025 amid ongoing trade uncertainties and rising global public debt. Even the most dynamic sectors, like aviation, anticipate annual growth rates that remain well below the 30% mark, despite benefiting from emerging markets and expanding middle-class populations. These trends are reflected in expert surveys and institutional outlooks, which consistently indicate incremental rather than explosive economic progress.

**Risk Assessment and the Status Quo Bias**

The vast majority of potential shocks to the global economy—whether pandemics, recessions, wars, or climate-related events—tend to be negative, reducing output rather than sparking sudden surges. The likelihood of a sufficiently large, positive "black swan" event remains remote. Experienced forecasters therefore place considerable weight on the continuation of historical trends, especially given the absence of credible projections for a single-year, 30% GWP surge.

In summary, the odds that real gross world product will experience a single-year jump of over 30% before 2043 are extremely low. Historical data, mainstream economic projections, and an array of structural, technological, and institutional factors all converge to make Bryan Caplan a strong favorite to win his bet, barring an unprecedented, immediate, and globally synchronized technological revolution—a scenario not supported by current evidence or expert consensus.
