(a) **Time left until outcome known:**  
There are about 7 months remaining until January 1, 2026, when it will be determined if Bluesky has reached 100 million users.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If Bluesky’s current average growth rate holds, it will have roughly 53 million users by December 2025, based on a steady rate of 1 new user per second[1]. This is significantly less than the 100 million user threshold required.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Bluesky grows at its current or slower pace, adding users steadily but without any major accelerations from external events, viral adoption, or product breakthroughs. Growth remains at about 1 user per second (or even slows further as the post-launch excitement wanes), leading to an end-of-2025 user count below 100 million, possibly in the 50–60 million range[1][3].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A major global event, viral campaign, or high-profile endorsement causes a sudden, sustained spike in signups—perhaps propelled by a large exodus from another major social media platform, or a unique feature launches that attracts massive mainstream attention. Bluesky’s monthly growth rate jumps and remains multiples above its current pace for several consecutive months, allowing it to more than triple its user base in just over half a year. For example, a return to the explosive 75%+ monthly growth seen during peak late 2024 could put 100 million users within reach, but sustaining that rate would require extraordinary circumstances well beyond any current trends[3][1].

## Rationale

Bluesky’s growth since its February 2024 public launch has been impressive—rising from around 13 million users in October 2024 to about 33 million by March 2025[1][2][3]. However, this surge was heavily concentrated in late 2024, particularly during key moments like the U.S. presidential election and heightened migration from X/Twitter.

Since then, growth has slowed substantially. The most recent data show the platform is adding roughly 1 user per second, which, if projected linearly, yields an end-of-2025 user base near 53 million—barely half of the 100 million target[1]. Even past periods of "explosive" growth (75% monthly rate in November 2024) were short-lived, with the December 2024 rate already down to 9.5%[1][4].

While Bluesky’s user demographics, decentralized positioning, and ongoing X/Twitter discontent could occasionally spur future bursts of adoption, history shows these surges are the exception, not the rule. The social media landscape is highly competitive, with multiple “alternative” platforms vying for attention, and most tend to follow a boom-then-steady pattern once the initial hype fades.

Therefore, absent a new and sustained catalyst, the status quo—steady, moderate growth—should be weighted most heavily. There is always some chance of another breakout event, but projecting exponential or sustained hypergrowth is not justified by current trends or user behavior data.

## Final Answer

**Probability: 10%**

It is currently very unlikely that Bluesky will reach 100 million users before the end of 2025, barring an unforeseen, dramatic surge in adoption well above current rates[1][3].
