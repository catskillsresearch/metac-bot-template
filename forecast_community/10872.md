The status quo outcome is that Lawrence v. Texas remains in effect, continuing to provide constitutional protection for consensual sexual activity between adults of the same sex. This outcome is supported by the absence of direct legal challenges currently moving through the courts and the strong influence of the doctrine of stare decisis, which upholds established precedents. The Supreme Court has not shown a recent inclination to revisit Lawrence v. Texas, and no new sodomy laws have been enacted that would directly challenge the ruling. 

While the Court's conservative majority could potentially impact future decisions, the lack of immediate legal challenges and the slow pace of legal change suggest stability in the current legal framework. Additionally, societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights have generally become more accepting, which may influence the Court's reluctance to overturn such a significant precedent. However, a scenario where a case challenging Lawrence v. Texas reaches the Supreme Court could arise, possibly due to a state enacting a new sodomy law or a related legal issue. In such a case, the Court might decide to overturn the precedent, ruling that there is no constitutionally protected right to consensual sex for same-sex couples. 

Overall, the probability of Lawrence v. Texas being overturned by 2030 remains relatively low, given the current legal landscape and societal context. Nonetheless, the possibility cannot be entirely dismissed due to the Court's composition and potential future cases that could challenge the principles established in Lawrence.
