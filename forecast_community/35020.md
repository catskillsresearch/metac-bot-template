(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
Approximately 7 months remain until the December 2025 data from Idealista determines whether Madrid city’s housing prices rise by more than 18% from December 2024 levels.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Madrid housing prices rose ~20% in 2024, reaching €4,952/m² in December 2024. As of Q1 2025, prices are up 15.1% year-on-year, but authoritative forecasts predict a sharp moderation, with expected increases for 2025 generally in the 5%–10% range, and high-end national forecasts for Madrid not surpassing 15% for the year[2][3][4][5]. If the current consensus holds, the outcome would be **No**—prices will increase, but not by more than 18%.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
- The rate of price growth slows, as projected by most analysts, due to the high 2024 base, increased supply (especially public and protected housing), and somewhat improved mortgage conditions[2][4][5].  
- By December 2025, the annual price increase is in the 5–12% range, in line with expert and institutional forecasts, meaning prices are up but well below the 18% threshold.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
- Market dynamics shift dramatically—possibly due to a sudden, unanticipated surge in international investor demand, or new supply constraints (e.g., major delays in planned housing projects, regulatory changes cutting new builds), or a macroeconomic shock driving buyers rapidly into real assets.
- Prices continue their 2024 acceleration uninterrupted, posting another year in the 18%+ range. This would defy prevailing forecasts and imply an overheating market or severe shortage, neither of which is currently backed by available data.

## Rationale

Recent data shows strong momentum: Madrid’s housing market prices increased by about 20% in 2024 and 15.1% year-on-year in Q1 2025[5]. However, most sector forecasters (including Idealista, Solvia, CaixaBank Research, and Bankinter) expect **growth to moderate significantly in 2025**, with projected city price increases generally in the high single digits to low double digits—most typically cited ranges are 5%–12%, with a few outliers suggesting a potential ceiling near 15% but not exceeding 18%[2][3][4][5].

Key drivers for this moderation include:

- **High base effect:** After such a sharp price increase in 2024, maintaining that pace requires continued (and accelerating) demand outstripping all supply, which is rarely sustained year-on-year.
- **Expansion in new housing supply:** Madrid’s regional government policies in 2024–2025 have led to a sharp increase in protected/public housing starts and completions, which should ease some pressure, especially in entry-level and mid-market segments.
- **Interest rate cuts:** While the ECB’s rate cuts are supportive of mortgage demand[2], the supply-side response and broader economic conditions are expected to balance or partially offset upward price pressure.
- **Market consensus:** All major forecasts converge on a marked slowdown in price growth for 2025[2][3][4][5].

While there are warning signs about longer-term affordability and persistent supply-demand imbalances, a repeat of the extraordinary 2024 price rise is considered improbable barring an extreme, unexpected event.

Professional forecasters weight the status quo outcome more heavily, recognizing real estate markets move gradually outside of crisis or boom scenarios. The current consensus is robust, and there is no clear catalyst for a sudden return to >18% annual growth for Madrid city housing prices in 2025.

**Probability: 5%**

Madrid housing prices are very likely to increase in 2025, but the probability they rise by more than 18% (December 2024–December 2025) is extremely low based on available forecasts and current policy trends[2][3][4][5].
