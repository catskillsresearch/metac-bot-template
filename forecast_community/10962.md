(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 months and 19 days (until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: No formal agreement between the US and India for nuclear submarines. Historically, the US has maintained that its laws prevent sharing nuclear propulsion technology, even with close allies.

(c) No outcome scenario: The US continues to expand defense cooperation with India through conventional means and limited technology transfers (like sensors for submarines), but maintains its longstanding policy of not sharing nuclear submarine technology due to legal restrictions and strategic considerations about nuclear proliferation.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Rapidly deteriorating regional security (particularly regarding China) leads to an unprecedented policy shift where the US decides to make an exception for India similar to the AUKUS agreement, announcing a formal agreement to provide nuclear submarine technology before January 2026.

Based on the current evidence and historical context, I assess that the US is unlikely to offer India a nuclear submarine before 2026. Here's my analysis:

## Current US-India Defense Cooperation

The United States and India have been strengthening their defense relationship, with the US determined to "expand defense sales and co-production with India to strengthen interoperability and defense industrial cooperation"[1]. However, this cooperation has specific boundaries and has not yet extended to nuclear submarine technology.

Recent developments show that the US is considering providing advanced underwater sensor technology used aboard its nuclear-powered attack submarines to India[4]. This represents a policy shift in terms of sharing sophisticated undersea systems, but falls well short of offering complete nuclear submarines or their propulsion technology.

## India's Submarine Development Strategy

India is actively pursuing its indigenous submarine capabilities through multiple channels:

1. In February 2025, the Indian Navy signed a contract with German company Thyssenkrupp to build 6 new diesel submarines[2].

2. India has approved Project 77 for the construction of two 9,800-tonne nuclear attack submarines (SSNs) powered by 190 MW pressurized water reactors, scheduled for completion by 2036-37[4].

3. India already operates the INS Arihant, an indigenous nuclear submarine commissioned in 2016, which carries submarine-launched ballistic missiles[2].

These developments suggest India is committed to developing its submarine fleet through a combination of indigenous efforts and international partnerships, but not specifically with the US for nuclear submarines.

## US Nuclear Submarine Policy

The US has historically maintained strict controls over its nuclear submarine technology. The AUKUS deal with Australia marked a rare exception, but even in that case:

1. The agreement faced significant criticism and diplomatic consequences (particularly with France).

2. It was made with one of America's closest traditional allies.

3. Recent reports indicate that the US Navy is focused on its own submarine development, including the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N) targeted for deployment by 2034[3].

4. There is no indication in the search results of any policy change regarding sharing nuclear submarine technology with India.

## Technological Transfer Considerations

While the US is considering sharing advanced sensor technology with India for its nuclear submarines[4], this is significantly different from providing entire nuclear submarines or their propulsion systems. The US appears to be pursuing a measured approach of enhancing India's existing capabilities rather than fundamentally transforming them through complete technology transfer.

There are concerns in the region about even limited technology transfers. A Pakistani think tank has expressed worries that the US approval allowing Holtec International to transfer Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology to India could potentially enhance India's submarine programs[5]. This suggests that even smaller technology transfers face regional scrutiny and strategic calculations.

## Status Quo Inertia

Given the complexity of nuclear submarine technology, the legal frameworks restricting its sharing, and the significant geopolitical implications of such a transfer, the status quo (no nuclear submarine offer) remains the most likely outcome. Policy changes of this magnitude typically require years of negotiation and preparation, and there are no indications in the search results that such a process is underway between the US and India.

## Alternative Cooperation Pathways

Instead of direct nuclear submarine transfers, the US-India relationship appears to be developing through:

1. Enhanced sensor and warfare systems technology transfer[4]
2. Expanded defense industrial cooperation[1]
3. Potential collaboration on Small Modular Reactor technology[5]

These pathways provide the benefits of closer strategic alignment without the complications of full nuclear submarine technology transfer.
