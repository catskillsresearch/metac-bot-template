# Solar Radiation Management: A Potential Climate Intervention in the 21st Century

Solar Radiation Management (SRM) encompasses various approaches designed to reflect sunlight back to space to cool the Earth. The most significant methods under consideration include stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT). As we examine the potential for large-scale SRM deployment in the 21st century, several key factors will determine whether this controversial approach will become a reality.

## Current Status of SRM Development and Governance

As of 2025, SRM remains primarily in the research phase, with no large-scale deployments yet undertaken. Several notable developments have shaped the SRM landscape:

- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has received approximately $35 million from 2020-2024 for Earth's Radiation Budget research initiative, which includes research on marine cloud brightening.

- The U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has established an interagency group to manage research associated with "climate intervention," coordinating with NASA, NOAA, and the Department of Energy.

- In January 2025, an updated report recommended adopting a moratorium on large-scale solar radiation modification while expanding research governance frameworks.

These developments indicate that while research is proceeding, there is strong resistance to deployment without proper governance structures in place.

## Key Barriers to Large-Scale Deployment

Several significant barriers currently stand in the way of large-scale SRM deployment:

1. **Governance challenges**: There is currently no international consensus or framework for deploying SRM technologies. Creating such a framework would require unprecedented global cooperation.

2. **Scientific uncertainties**: Despite modeling efforts, significant knowledge gaps remain about regional impacts, effects on precipitation patterns, and potential unintended consequences of SRM deployment.

3. **Termination shock risk**: If SRM were deployed at scale and then suddenly discontinued, rapid warming could occur, potentially causing more harm than a gradual warming scenario.

4. **Moral hazard concerns**: Many policymakers worry that pursuing SRM could undermine efforts to reduce emissions, while not addressing other impacts like ocean acidification.

5. **Public and geopolitical resistance**: Widespread skepticism, ethical concerns, and the risk of causing international conflict are significant obstacles to deployment.

## Climate Change Trajectory and SRM Potential

The climate would respond differently to albedo-increasing solar geoengineering than to emissions abatement or carbon dioxide removal (CDR). For one thing, greenhouse gases absorb outgoing longwave radiation at all times and latitudes, whereas incoming sunlight is reflected in proportion to solar irradiance, which is greatest during the summer, at midday, and at low latitudes.

Another crucial difference is that SRM effects would manifest relatively rapidly—on a timescale of months—and would be reversible on a similar timeframe. In contrast, the avoided climate change from emissions abatement and CDR is delayed by decades due to the time required to meaningfully affect greenhouse gas concentrations. This indicates that solar geoengineering could be used to manage short-term climate change risks from extant emissions in ways that emissions abatement and CDR cannot.

Current projections suggest that warming will surpass 1.5°C by the end of this decade and 2°C by 2050, which could result in disastrous climate impacts. The potentially catastrophic climate impacts and the possibility of passing climate tipping points, such as thawing of the Arctic permafrost or the dieback of the Amazon rainforest, could necessitate the use of what were once unthinkable strategies.

## Potential Pathways to Deployment

Despite the barriers, several pathways could lead to large-scale SRM deployment by 2101:

1. **Climate emergency response**: If climate impacts become severe enough to create widespread humanitarian crises and threaten global stability, political pressure for rapid intervention could override governance concerns.

2. **International cooperation breakthrough**: A new international governance mechanism could emerge that allows for coordinated decision-making on SRM deployment, particularly as climate impacts worsen.

3. **Technological advancement**: Significant improvements in SRM technologies and modeling could reduce uncertainties and risks, making deployment more acceptable.

4. **Temporary "Plan B" deployment**: SRM could be used as a temporary means to slow climate change or to limit warming as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations "overshoot" the levels associated with warming targets.

5. **Global South advocacy**: As climate-vulnerable countries in the Global South experience disproportionate impacts, international pressure for consideration of SRM could increase dramatically.

## The Long-Term Perspective

Given the 75-year timeframe until 2101, the calculus around SRM deployment may shift dramatically as climate impacts intensify. While current governance frameworks explicitly recommend against large-scale deployment in the near term, suggesting a conservative approach, the risk-benefit assessment could change substantially if:

- Emissions reductions prove insufficient (as current trends suggest)
- Climate impacts become severe enough to threaten global stability
- Technological advances reduce uncertainties about SRM effects
- International governance frameworks evolve to manage deployment risks

The most likely timeframe for potential deployment would be in the latter half of the century, giving sufficient time for governance frameworks to evolve and for the technology to mature. Even then, success in maintaining temperatures below 1.5°C while CO2 exceeds 600 ppm remains uncertain.

## The Role of SRM in a Comprehensive Climate Strategy

For SRM to be deployed at scale, it would likely need to be positioned as part of a comprehensive climate strategy rather than a standalone solution. Solar geoengineering should complement—not substitute for—emissions abatement, CDR, and adaptation. It could potentially be used as a temporary measure to manage short-term climate risks while longer-term solutions take effect.

The necessary conditions for large-scale SRM deployment before 2101 would likely include extreme failure of all mitigation, adaptation, and carbon removal strategies; severe, undeniable climate emergencies; and a rapid international reversal of governance, public, and scientific caution—an unlikely confluence but not impossible given the long timeframe.

## Weighing SRM Risks and Possible Benefits

Models have shown that SRM techniques, specifically SAI, have the potential to exert effective radiative forcing of a large enough magnitude to counteract greenhouse gas forcings. With this, SRM can prevent further global warming and has the potential to reduce various related impacts, including floods, heatwaves, sea-level rise, hurricanes, and melting of glaciers.

However, SRM does not address the direct impacts of elevated greenhouse gas concentrations, such as ocean acidification. SRM would have regionally and temporally diverse impacts on surface temperature and acts differently on the hydrological cycle compared to greenhouse gas forcings.
