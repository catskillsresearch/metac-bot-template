# Rationale for Texas Measles Case Projection as of June 14, 2025

The current measles outbreak in Texas has reached 722 confirmed cases as of May 20, 2025. To project the case count by June 14, 2025 (24 days from now), we need to analyze recent trends, expert assessments, and potential scenarios.

## Current Situation and Trends

The outbreak that began in late January 2025 has shown clear signs of deceleration in recent weeks. The most recent data shows only 4 new cases reported in the past week, a significant decline from earlier periods when dozens of new cases were reported weekly. Less than 1% of current cases are considered actively infectious, suggesting that containment efforts are proving effective.

The outbreak has primarily affected West Texas counties, with Gaines County accounting for the majority of cases (406). Several counties have already been removed from the active transmission list after passing two incubation periods without new cases, including Garza and Lynn counties.

## Projection Based on Current Trajectory

Given the current rate of approximately 4 new cases per week, we can expect about 14 additional cases over the next 3.5 weeks (until June 14). This would bring the total to approximately 736 cases.

However, the weekly case rate has been variable, ranging from 4-9 cases in recent weeks. Using the higher end of this range would suggest up to 30-32 additional cases by June 14, resulting in a total of 752-754 cases.

## Factors Affecting the Projection

Several key factors will influence the final case count:

1. **Vaccination and containment effectiveness**: Ongoing vaccination campaigns in outbreak areas have been intensifying, particularly targeting communities with lower immunization rates.

2. **Geographic spread**: The outbreak remains concentrated in specific counties with lower vaccination coverage. The risk of spread to new counties exists but appears to be diminishing.

3. **Remaining susceptible population**: While Texas's overall vaccination rate is 94.2% (below the 95% herd immunity threshold), pockets of under-vaccinated communities remain vulnerable.

4. **Public health response**: Exclusion from schools and other containment measures have contributed to the slowing transmission rate.

## Potential Low-Case Scenario

If containment efforts prove even more effective than anticipated, we could see a rapid halt to transmission. Enhanced surveillance and targeted vaccination in remaining outbreak areas might result in virtually no new cases by June 14. In this optimistic scenario, the case count would remain very close to the current 722 cases.

## Potential High-Case Scenario

A superspreading event could reverse the current slowing trend. This might include:

- Undetected exposure in a large, unvaccinated group
- A new cluster emerging in a previously unaffected county with low vaccination rates
- Imported cases from neighboring states or Mexico (which has reported outbreaks in border regions)
- Spread to urban centers with pockets of unvaccinated individuals

In such scenarios, we could see a sudden spike adding 70-100 new cases, potentially bringing the total to 790-820 cases by June 14.

## Summary Assessment

The measles outbreak in Texas is showing strong signs of deceleration, with only 4 new cases reported in the most recent week. Based on current trends, we expect the total case count by June 14, 2025, to most likely fall between 735-755 cases, assuming the current trajectory continues.

While there remains a possibility of either a complete halt in transmission (resulting in little to no increase from the current 722 cases) or a resurgence due to a new cluster or superspreading event (potentially pushing the count above 790), the most probable outcome is a continued slow increase at the current rate of 4-9 cases per week.
