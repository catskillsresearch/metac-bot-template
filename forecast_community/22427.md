(a) Time left until outcome: 4 years, 7 months (from May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2029)

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, there are approximately 5 leading AI labs based on model ELO ratings (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Cohere, and Mistral AI). Of these, Anthropic and Mistral AI achieved leading status relatively quickly after founding.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: A major technological breakthrough occurs in 2026, similar to the transformer architecture or diffusion models, which dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for creating high-performing AI models. This enables several well-funded startups to rapidly develop competitive models, bypassing the current compute and data advantages of established players. Additionally, a significant talent exodus from current leading labs creates 3-4 new powerful contenders within a short timeframe.

Based on the search results and current AI landscape, I'll provide my forecast for how many new AI labs will become leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030.

## Historical Patterns and Current Trends

The AI landscape has experienced significant growth and transformation since the release of ChatGPT. According to the search results, several well-funded AI startups like Xaira Therapeutics have emerged in related fields like AI drug discovery, receiving substantial funding ($1 billion for Xaira)[1]. While these aren't necessarily general-purpose AI labs competing on model ELO ratings, they demonstrate the continued strong investment interest in AI startups.

In the current landscape, we can observe that Anthropic (founded in 2021) and Mistral AI (founded in 2023) both achieved "leading" status relatively quickly after their founding. This suggests that rapid ascension to the top tier is possible, particularly when founded by alumni of existing leading labs with strong technical expertise and substantial funding.

## Key Factors Affecting New Leading Labs

1. **Talent Availability**: Many leading AI researchers are currently concentrated at the top labs. For new labs to emerge, they would likely need to attract talent from existing organizations.

2. **Compute Access**: Building leading AI models requires enormous computational resources. The search results mention AI supercomputers potentially requiring as much power as a city by 2030, with costs potentially reaching $200 billion to build.

3. **Funding Environment**: While AI investment remains strong, there's growing concentration of resources. The search results indicate that only 100 companies are responsible for 40% of the world's private investment in AI research and development.

4. **Technological Breakthroughs**: New algorithmic approaches or architectures could potentially enable more efficient model training, lowering barriers to entry.

5. **Regulatory Environment**: Increasing regulation of AI could potentially impact the ability of new labs to compete.

## Forecast Reasoning

Looking at the period from now (May 2025) until the end of 2029:

- The current trend shows substantial funding for AI ventures continues. The search results mention several well-funded AI startups in various domains[1][5].
- We've seen Anthropic and Mistral AI achieve "leading" status relatively quickly after founding, demonstrating that with the right talent and funding, new entrants can compete.
- There appears to be ongoing talent movement in the AI field, with reports of potential high-profile departures like Demis Hassabis considering leaving DeepMind.
- The search results show continued strong interest in AI, with the market size expected to reach over $181 billion by 2030.

However, several factors limit the number of new leading labs:
- Increasing compute requirements create substantial barriers to entry
- AI development is becoming increasingly concentrated among well-resourced players
- Building competitive foundation models requires significant expertise and resources

Given these considerations, I assess that we're likely to see 2-3 new AI labs founded after May 2025 becoming leading labs within 2 years of their founding and before 2030. These would likely be founded by high-profile researchers departing from existing leading labs, with substantial funding and potentially leveraging new algorithmic approaches to compete effectively.

I assign a moderate probability to 0-1 new leading labs, accounting for the possibility that barriers to entry become prohibitively high or that new labs take longer than 2 years to reach leading status. I also assign some probability to 4-5 or more new leading labs, representing scenarios where technological breakthroughs or regulatory changes significantly alter the competitive landscape.
