(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
As of May 13, 2025, there are approximately 7.5 months (about 233 days) until January 1, 2026, when this question will be resolved.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If current trends and processes continue, the US will *not* have fully broken up Google by January 1, 2026. Although the government is pursuing strong remedies, including potential divestiture orders, no breakup has been ordered or executed, and Google’s legal appeals and the complexity of structural remedies make rapid completion unlikely[1][4][5].

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The courts or regulatory agencies could order structural remedies (e.g., break up) in 2025, but Google immediately appeals, or the practical process of divestiture (spinning off divisions, regulatory compliance, establishing new governance for spun-out companies) takes longer than the seven remaining months. In this scenario, even if a breakup is eventually mandated, it would not be fully completed—meaning the specified divisions would not be fully divested and operating independently—before January 1, 2026[4].

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The DOJ and/or FTC not only win court rulings ordering a breakup of key Google divisions (such as Chrome, AdTech, or Android), but the remedy is not stayed by appeals, all practical and legal hurdles are overcome, and the divestitures of one or more qualifying divisions are fully executed before January 1, 2026. This would require an unprecedentedly fast legal and operational process, far quicker than any prior major US antitrust breakup[1][4][5].

## Rationale

**Legal and Regulatory Context:**  
As of May 2025, the US Department of Justice has prevailed in significant antitrust cases against Google, with federal judges finding the company liable for maintaining illegal monopolies in both search and digital advertising markets[1]. The DOJ is very publicly pushing for structural remedies, including potential divestitures of major divisions like Chrome and segments of Google’s advertising business. Hearings and proposal phases are ongoing; Google is actively resisting, and has indicated that it will appeal any orders for breakup[4].

**What Is Required for a "Yes":**  
The forecast question’s resolution requires not an order or plan, but the *completion* of a breakup—meaning Google must fully divest at least one of the specified core divisions and have it operating as a separate company, all before January 1, 2026.

**Historical Precedent:**  
Major US antitrust breakups—such as AT&T in the 1980s or Standard Oil in 1911—have taken several years between court order and the final completion of actual divestitures. Even if a breakup order is issued against Google in the coming months, the combination of appeals, court procedures, and operational hurdles makes a full, completed separation in less than eight months highly improbable[4].

**Current Momentum and Realistic Timelines:**  
The DOJ is aggressively pursuing these remedies, and court momentum is real. There is some probability that a judge could order a breakup in 2025, but unless Google unexpectedly forgoes appeals and there is a near-miraculous acceleration of the divestiture process, it will almost certainly not be *completed* before the deadline[4].

**Status Quo and Inertia:**  
Forecasters should weight the status quo outcome heavily: structural breakups of major technology firms are rare, slow, and heavily litigated, with many opportunities for delay and modification. Google is an especially complex global business, making operations slower than with a single-industry legacy monopoly[4].

## Final Forecast

Given the current legal process, historical timelines, ongoing appeals, and the complexity of a forced breakup, I assess that the probability the US will fully break up Google—meaning the divestiture and operational independence of at least one major division is completed—before January 1, 2026 is:

**Probability: 7%**

This estimate reflects a small but nonzero risk of an exceptionally rapid breakup, but the overwhelmingly likely outcome is "No": no completed breakup by the deadline[1][4].
