A combination of court rulings, ongoing legal challenges, and recent executive actions has introduced high uncertainty into the outlook for the effective US tariff rate on goods imported into the United States for the end of 2026. Currently, following a major court decision in May 2025 that struck down many emergency tariffs, the effective tariff rate stands near 6.5%–7%. This level is sustained by the persistence of targeted sectoral tariffs, such as Section 232 measures on steel, autos, and aluminum, and Section 301 tariffs on selected Chinese imports. If this legal and policy status quo persists, the effective tariff rate is likely to remain in the upper single digits through the end of 2026, with incremental fluctuations possible due to ongoing policy negotiations and minor adjustments.

Expert and market outlooks reflect the spectrum of legal and political uncertainty. Professional forecasters, such as Morningstar and the Yale Budget Lab, have revised their estimates downward from initial expectations of 15%–22% (assuming full implementation of previously announced broad tariffs) to 7%–15% after the court intervention. Morningstar currently projects an average effective tariff rate of around 15% at the end of 2026, assuming partial re-imposition of tariffs, while markets and business sentiment are leaning toward a scenario of limited escalation, with rates closer to present levels unless significant new developments occur. Morgan Stanley highlights an upper-bound scenario up to 22% contingent on renewed, comprehensive tariff actions, but recent legal outcomes have made such extremes less probable in the prevailing policy environment.

The lower-tail scenario would materialize if judicial decisions blocking broad tariffs are upheld at the highest levels, and if Congress or the administration refrains from further escalation. Additional trade negotiations or international agreements could further reduce sectoral tariffs, potentially driving the effective tariff rate down to the 3%–6% range, nearing pre-2025 levels.

Conversely, a higher-end outcome could result if the administration prevails in appeals or crafts new legal mechanisms to restore sweeping tariffs, or if major geopolitical or economic shocks trigger reciprocal tariff spirals. Such developments could rapidly re-elevate the effective rate to 15%–22% or higher, reminiscent of the levels experienced in the wake of earlier tariff expansions. Responding international partners may impose their own barriers, compounding the elevation in trade restrictions.

In sum, the most likely scenario for the end of 2026 is an effective US tariff rate anchored in the high single to low double digits, reflecting a balance between the persistence of sectoral tariffs and ongoing legal, political, and diplomatic headwinds against sweeping new tariff regimes. Notable tail risks remain on both the downside (broad rollback) and upside (successful restoration or escalation of protectionist measures), with the trajectory hinging on the outcomes of pending court cases, legislative initiatives, and international economic developments.
