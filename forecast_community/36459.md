(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
There are just under five months remaining before October 1, 2025, which is the resolution deadline for this question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no legislative action occurs, the individual tax cuts from the 2017 TCJA will expire at the end of 2025, reverting tax rates, the standard deduction, the Child Tax Credit, and estate tax exemptions to pre-TCJA levels[1][5]. Under this scenario, the question would resolve as **No**.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No will occur if:
- Both a reconciliation bill for spending and a reconciliation bill for revenue are enacted before the TCJA extension using a "current policy" baseline, or
- No reconciliation bill that extends any of the four counted TCJA individual tax provisions using a "current policy" baseline is enacted by October 1, 2025.

This could happen, for example, if intra-party divisions prevent agreement on the budget baseline, the Senate's current policy baseline is rejected or not brought up for a vote, or the House insists on the "current law" baseline due to deficit concerns or procedural issues, resulting in legislative gridlock[1][4][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes will occur if, before October 1, 2025, Congress enacts a reconciliation bill that extends at least one of the specified TCJA individual tax cuts—and the bill uses a "current policy" baseline in the Senate reconciliation process, as reported by credible sources.

This would require:
- Senate Republicans successfully advancing their current budget resolution, which uses a "current policy" baseline for the TCJA extensions[4].
- The House agreeing to this approach (overcoming some opposition from deficit-focused Republicans), and
- Final passage and Presidential signature before the October 1 deadline.

## Rationale

- Senate Republicans have made clear their intent to use a "current policy" baseline in their 2025 budget resolution, with the explicit goal of making the TCJA individual provisions permanent[4].
- The House is less certain: while also aiming for extension, House Republicans have shown greater concern about the deficit impact and may resist the Senate's approach due to procedural and fiscal constraints[4].
- The reconciliation process requires both chambers to align on a budget resolution, and any differences must be negotiated. The closer it gets to October 1, the more pressure there will be to compromise, possibly resulting in a temporary extension or reversion to the "current law" baseline[1][4].
- There is no clear indication so far that both a spending and a revenue reconciliation bill have already been enacted, so the procedural route for a TCJA extension remains open.

Good forecasters recognize that the status quo—no extension using a "current policy" baseline—tends to persist unless significant political breakthrough occurs. Given intra-party divides in the House, uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations between chambers, and remaining time but lack of a final bill, most weight should be placed on the status quo.

## Final Answer

Probability: **35%**

(There is significant Senate momentum for a "current policy" baseline, but substantial House resistance and procedural complexity make a successful enactment by October 1, 2025 less likely than not, though far from impossible.)
