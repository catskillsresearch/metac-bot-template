(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
The outcome will be known when Eurostat releases Q3 2025 GDP figures, typically published in late November or early December 2025. As of May 9, 2025, this is approximately 6 to 7 months away.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo is that Spain's GDP growth is significantly outpacing the Eurozone average. For the year ending Q3 2024, Spain grew 3.5% year-on-year while the Eurozone as a whole grew only 0.9%[5]. All major forecasts suggest that Spain will continue to outgrow the Eurozone through 2025[1][2][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome would occur if the Eurozone's year-on-year GDP growth from Q3 2024 to Q3 2025 matches or exceeds Spain's. This could happen if:
- The Eurozone experiences a sharp, unexpected rebound (e.g., strong monetary stimulus, unexpectedly rapid German or French recovery, or advanced EU-wide investment programs).
- Spain faces a significant negative shock, such as a sudden drop in tourism, a sharp rise in unemployment, political instability, or adverse effects from tariffs and supply constraints that depress domestic demand, causing Spanish growth to fall below the Eurozone average.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome will materialize if Spain continues to grow faster than the Eurozone average from Q3 2024 to Q3 2025. The current consensus expects this, attributed to:
- Ongoing strong domestic demand, especially from private consumption and wage growth[2][5].
- Continued resilience in Spain's labor market and investment[1][5].
- The Eurozone recovering but at a slower pace, as most forecasts predict only modest improvement compared to Spain’s more robust growth outlook[1][2][3].

## Rationale

Recent history and near-term forecasts both favor Spain’s continued outperformance. The underlying drivers—private consumption, labor market strength, and relatively resilient domestic demand—appear persistent[1][2][5]. The Eurozone, while set to see some recovery, has not closed the growth gap, and no major forecaster anticipates a reversal[1][3]. A negative shock to Spain or a major, unexpected Eurozone surge could alter the picture, but these are not baseline expectations. Good forecasting practice puts heavy weight on the status quo and observed momentum, especially given the slow pace of macroeconomic change.
