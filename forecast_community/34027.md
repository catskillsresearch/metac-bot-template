Based on the search results and the current date (May 13, 2025), I'll provide a professional forecasting analysis on whether President Trump will formally invoke the Insurrection Act before 2026.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 7 months and 19 days (until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: President Trump has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act, despite issuing executive orders declaring a national emergency at the southern border and directing cabinet officials to evaluate whether to invoke it.

(c) No outcome scenario: The Trump administration continues to use existing authorities, including the national emergency declaration and other immigration enforcement mechanisms, without formally invoking the Insurrection Act. Border crossing numbers remain low enough that Defense Secretary Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Noem continue to advise against invoking the Act.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: President Trump formally invokes the Insurrection Act in response to either a real or perceived escalation at the southern border, citing the need for military deployment to address immigration concerns. This follows through on the groundwork laid in his January 2025 executive order declaring a national emergency.

## Current Status and Timeline

President Trump has taken significant steps that suggest he is seriously considering invoking the Insurrection Act, but has not yet formally done so. Key developments include:

- January 20, 2025: Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border and directing the Secretary of Defense (Pete Hegseth) and Secretary of Homeland Security (Kristi Noem) to submit a report within 90 days evaluating whether to invoke the Insurrection Act[2][4].

- April 20, 2025 (approximately): The 90-day deadline for the cabinet secretaries' report. According to search results, top officials at the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security did not recommend invoking the Act at that time due to low levels of migrant crossings.

- April 18, 2025: Rep. Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued a statement expressing concerns about Trump potentially invoking the Insurrection Act[1].

## Key Factors Supporting Invocation

1. **Formal Framework Already Established**: Trump has already declared a national emergency at the southern border, which creates the legal foundation for potentially invoking the Insurrection Act[2].

2. **Strong Rhetoric**: Trump has characterized the situation at the border in extreme terms, describing it as "overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries"[2].

3. **Previous Executive Actions**: Trump has already taken significant immigration-related executive actions, including a March 15, 2025 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act regarding the alleged "invasion" of the United States by Tren de Aragua (designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization)[3].

## Key Factors Against Invocation

1. **Current Low Border Crossing Numbers**: According to search results, fewer than 300 people are crossing the southern border illegally each day, which DHS sources indicated does not justify military involvement.

2. **Advice From Cabinet Officials**: Top Pentagon and DHS officials apparently advised against invoking the Act based on current conditions.

3. **Political and Legal Risks**: The Insurrection Act exists in tension with the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents the federal military from acting as a police force without clear authorization[4]. Invoking it could trigger significant legal challenges and political backlash.

## Analysis and Reasoning

The probability of Trump invoking the Insurrection Act before 2026 depends on weighing several competing factors:

**Status Quo Bias**: The status quo is that the Act has not been invoked, and there are significant legal and political barriers to doing so. Most presidents are reluctant to take such extraordinary measures due to these constraints.

**Trump's Demonstrated Intent**: However, Trump has already laid significant groundwork for invoking the Act, including declaring a national emergency and specifically directing his cabinet to evaluate whether to invoke it. This indicates a serious consideration rather than merely rhetorical posturing[2][4].

**Border Situation Evolution**: The current reported low levels of border crossings weigh against invocation, but this could change over the coming months, especially if there's a real or perceived increase in migration.

**Political Calculation**: Trump may see invoking the Act as fulfilling a campaign promise to take strong action on immigration, but must balance this against potential negative political and legal consequences.

While there are many factors pointing toward Trump potentially invoking the Act, we must give significant weight to the status quoâ€”that presidents rarely take such extraordinary measures, and the reported advice against invocation from key cabinet officials. However, the explicit consideration in executive actions and Trump's demonstrated willingness to take unprecedented steps in immigration enforcement significantly increases the probability.

Probability: 45%
