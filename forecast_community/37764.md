California's outlook for Q1 2025 annualized GDP growth reflects a moderation from the 6.0% growth observed in Q4 2024. Current trends point to a baseline near 5.0%, supported by a combination of softer real growth and modest nominal tailwinds. This assessment aligns with prevailing market and expert expectations, which generally center the median outcome at 5.0% with most estimates clustering within a relatively narrow range from about 4.5% to 5.5%.

Several factors could influence deviations from this central forecast. On the downside, unexpected challenges—such as disruptions in key sectors like technology and housing, renewed trade frictions, tightened credit conditions, or adverse policy moves—could conceivably depress growth toward the lower end of the range, near 4.5%. On the other hand, favorable developments—such as a strong rebound in housing investments, robust performance in the tech sector alongside improved credit conditions, or easing of trade tensions—could push growth toward the upper end, around 5.5%.

Overall, while the baseline remains at about 5.0%, the moderate uncertainty reflects the possibility that sector-specific shocks or boosts could narrow the actual outcomes to a range between 4.5% and 5.5% for Q1 2025.
