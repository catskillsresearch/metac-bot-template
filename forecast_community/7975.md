The current trajectory towards the formation of a European Army by 2032 suggests a low likelihood, primarily due to the absence of concrete legislative steps and the strong emphasis on national sovereignty among EU member states. Defense remains largely a national prerogative, with countries prioritizing their own defense strategies and commitments to NATO over the establishment of a supranational military force. While there are ongoing efforts to enhance defense capabilities through increased spending and cooperation, these initiatives do not align with the criteria necessary for forming a European Army.

The historical reluctance of EU member states to cede national defense sovereignty further complicates the potential for significant integration. The slow pace of change in defense integration, coupled with political resistance in key countries like France, Germany, and the UK, underscores the challenges in achieving consensus on such a substantial step.

However, the possibility of a significant geopolitical event or threat cannot be entirely dismissed. Such an event could potentially catalyze a rapid shift in defense policy, prompting legislative actions in at least five European countries, including one of the major powers, to establish a European Army. This would require overcoming existing political and sovereignty barriers, driven by a perceived existential threat or a major conflict near EU borders.

In summary, while the status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome, the unpredictable nature of geopolitical dynamics leaves room for potential shifts that could accelerate defense integration efforts. Nonetheless, given the current status and historical trends, the establishment of a European Army by 2032 remains unlikely.
