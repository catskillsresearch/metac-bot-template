Over the next four to five years, a significant shift in admissions strategies is expected among top U.S. colleges. Currently, if existing policies remain untouched, only a small fraction of these institutions—around 16%—operate on a test‐optional basis. However, evolving practices and a growing reliance on holistic review methods suggest that, should current trends persist, roughly half of these elite schools could transition away from mandatory standardized testing by 2030.

This mid‐range outlook is supported by a broad consensus among experts and market observers. At the same time, the trajectory of change remains sensitive to unforeseen factors. On one hand, there is the possibility that strong political or administrative pressure—backed by legal or accreditation bodies—could prompt a reinstatement of standardized testing requirements at many institutions, resulting in a considerably lower rate of test‐optional policies. On the other hand, a robust push toward embracing alternative assessments, diversity initiatives, and equity-driven reforms could accelerate the trend, driving the prevalence of test‐optional practices to much higher levels.

In summary, while steady, gradual changes are pointing toward a future where approximately 50% of top colleges might adopt test‐optional admissions, significant deviations remain plausible depending on how political, legal, and cultural forces evolve over the coming years.
