The likelihood of Europa being the first place where humanity discovers extraterrestrial life before 2045 is influenced by several key factors. The cancellation of the Europa Clipper mission has significantly diminished the chances of Europa being the initial site of such a discovery. Europa presents substantial technical challenges and a harsh environment, making it a difficult target for exploration. Meanwhile, other celestial bodies like Mars and Enceladus, as well as distant exoplanets, are more accessible and have ongoing or planned missions that could potentially yield discoveries sooner.

Mars is a particularly strong candidate due to its proximity and the extensive exploration efforts already underway. The presence of organic molecules and evidence of past water activity on Mars further enhance its potential for hosting life. Additionally, advancements in telescope technology, such as the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope, have increased the feasibility of detecting biosignatures on exoplanets. The recent detection of potential signs of life on exoplanet K2-18b exemplifies the rapid progress in this area.

Enceladus, with its active geysers and subsurface ocean, also remains a promising candidate for the discovery of extraterrestrial life. NASA's interest in exploring Enceladus further underscores its potential. Given these considerations, the probability of Europa being the first location where extraterrestrial life is discovered is relatively low, as other locations present more immediate and promising opportunities for such a groundbreaking discovery.
