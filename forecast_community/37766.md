There are roughly 16 days left until the outcome on June 28, 2025 is determined. Under normal circumstances—with no dramatic shifts—the podcast has consistently performed well within a niche audience, placing it outside the top 20 but still solidly within the top 50. Historical performance, current trends, and the competitive landscape dominated by more mainstream or celebrity-driven shows all point toward a ranking roughly between 21st and 50th if conditions remain stable.

However, several factors could trigger an unexpected shift. For instance, if the hosts release a breakthrough or viral episode—possibly featuring a high-profile guest—or secure a strategic sponsorship or cross-promotion that captures widespread attention, such events might propel the podcast into the top 20. On the other hand, unanticipated external issues such as significant changes to Spotify’s algorithm, technical disruptions, or setbacks for key competitors could also cause the ranking to deviate from the expected range, either upward or downward. 

This reasoning reflects both the conservative status quo based on recent trends and the possibility for surprises should major events occur in the coming weeks.
