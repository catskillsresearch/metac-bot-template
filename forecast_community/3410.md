The current data and trends indicate a strong likelihood that the average global CO₂ atmospheric concentration over the 2024 to 2027 period will exceed 423.89 ppm. As of mid-2025, CO₂ levels are already near record highs, with 2024 showing concentrations around 422.8 ppm and projections for 2025 suggesting further increases. This upward trajectory is driven by ongoing emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities, compounded by natural variability such as El Niño events, which can exacerbate the rise in atmospheric CO₂ levels.

Achieving a scenario where the average CO₂ concentration is less than or equal to 423.89 ppm would require a significant and rapid reduction in global CO₂ emissions. This could be accomplished through unprecedented international cooperation, aggressive climate policies, and technological breakthroughs in carbon capture and storage. Additionally, enhancing the capacity of natural carbon sinks, such as through large-scale reforestation and ocean restoration projects, would be necessary. However, the historical trend of slow change in global emissions and the lack of immediate impactful policies or technological advancements make this scenario highly unlikely.

The continuation of current trends, without significant new policies or technological breakthroughs, supports the expectation that CO₂ levels will remain above the threshold. The status quo outcome is heavily weighted towards a Yes resolution, where the average CO₂ concentration exceeds 423.89 ppm, given the historical inertia in emissions and the current lack of substantial efforts to curb them.
