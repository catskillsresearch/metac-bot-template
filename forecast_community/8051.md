The question of whether armed conflicts between the United States and the People's Republic of China will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2050 is complex and multifaceted. Several key factors must be considered when assessing this possibility.

The status quo of no direct armed conflict between the US and China has persisted for decades, despite periods of high tension. Both nations have strong incentives to avoid war, given the catastrophic potential consequences and their economic interdependence. However, the long time horizon until 2050 introduces significant uncertainty and increases the risk of conflict.

Several factors contribute to the potential for armed confrontation:

1. Increasing military competition and tension, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea.
2. Explicit war planning and military buildup on both sides.
3. Economic decoupling, which may reduce barriers to conflict.
4. The relatively low threshold of 100 deaths, which could be reached even in a limited engagement.

The US-China relationship appears to be deteriorating, with multiple flashpoints that could lead to armed confrontation. Taiwan remains the most likely trigger for a potential conflict, with the possibility of China attempting a blockade or limited invasion, prompting US military intervention.

However, powerful deterrents against war exist, including nuclear weapons and the potential for massive economic disruption. Both sides have strong incentives to avoid direct conflict and maintain crisis management mechanisms. Leadership changes and unforeseen events over the next decades could also alter the trajectory of relations.

The long time frame until 2050 allows for significant geopolitical shifts and increases the probability of an incident occurring. However, it also provides numerous opportunities for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions.

Balancing these factors, while still giving weight to the long-standing status quo, there is a notable but minority chance of armed conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths before 2050. The probability is higher than the historical baseline but remains below 50%, reflecting the strong incentives for both nations to avoid catastrophic conflict while acknowledging the increasing risks and tensions in their relationship.
