# Forecast for US Average Gas Price on June 23, 2025

As of May 28, 2025, we have 26 days until we'll know the actual average gas price in the US on June 23, 2025. To develop a comprehensive forecast, I'll analyze current market conditions, expert projections, and potential factors that could influence gas prices in the coming weeks.

## Current Price Environment

If current conditions persist, we would expect the average US gas price to be approximately $3.16 per gallon on June 23, based on the EIA's Q2 2025 forecast. Recent data shows the national average was approximately $3.17-$3.18 per gallon during the Memorial Day weekend.

The current trend shows a slight downward trajectory as we move from Q2 to Q3 2025. The EIA projects Q2 prices to average $3.16 per gallon and Q3 prices to average $3.12 per gallon. Since June 23 falls near the end of Q2, we might expect the price to be transitioning toward the Q3 average, suggesting a price of around $3.14 per gallon if this trend continues.

## Expert Forecasts and Market Expectations

The January 2025 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook initially forecasted US average gasoline prices in 2025 to decrease by 11 cents per gallon (about 3%) compared to 2024. In their most recent May 2025 update, they project regular gasoline retail prices to average $3.09 per gallon for the full year 2025, down from $3.31 per gallon in 2024.

GasBuddy's 2025 Fuel Price Outlook published in January 2025 projected an annual average of $3.22 per gallon, with prices in June likely between $3.20-$3.30 per gallon. This forecast aligns with their projection of a third consecutive year of lower gas prices, down from $3.33 in 2024.

## Key Price Drivers

Several factors are influencing gasoline prices in 2025:

- **Declining crude oil prices**: The primary driver pushing gasoline prices lower
- **Increasing fleet fuel economy**: Contributing to decreasing gasoline consumption, particularly in 2026
- **Decreasing US refinery capacity**: Partially offsetting the downward pressure from lower crude oil prices
- **Seasonal factors**: June typically sees relatively stable prices after the Memorial Day peak

## Potential Low-Price Scenario

A sudden acceleration in crude oil price declines could push prices below $3.00 per gallon. This might occur if:
- OPEC+ significantly increases production in June
- Summer driving demand is lower than expected
- Economic concerns reduce travel
- Refinery outages are minimal
- Global economic growth slows unexpectedly

Such a combination of factors could potentially drive prices down to the $2.90-$3.00 range.

## Potential High-Price Scenario

Conversely, several factors could cause prices to spike toward $3.40 per gallon or higher:
- A sudden refinery outage or series of outages
- Geopolitical tensions affecting oil supply chains
- A surge in summer travel demand beyond forecasts
- Severe weather events (particularly hurricanes) affecting Gulf Coast refineries
- Supply chain disruptions

## Regional Variations

It's important to note that gas prices vary significantly by region in the US. While some areas might see prices below $3.00, others (particularly California and the West Coast) could experience prices well above the national average due to state-specific regulations, taxes, and supply constraints.

## Uncertainty Factors

With just 26 days until June 23, several unknown factors could still influence prices:
- Weather events affecting refineries or driving patterns
- Economic data releases that could impact crude oil markets
- Potential OPEC+ decisions
- Unexpected refinery maintenance or outages
- Consumer behavior changes as summer vacation season begins

The EIA's forecasted price trajectory shows a gradual decline throughout 2025, which suggests stability in the short term with a slight downward bias as we approach June 23.

The average US gas price on June 23, 2025, will most likely fall between $3.10 and $3.17 per gallon, with potential for moderate deviations in either direction based on the factors discussed.
