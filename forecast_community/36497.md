# Analysis of US-Iran Nuclear Agreement Prospects by September 2025

The prospects for the United States and Iran signing an agreement restricting Iran's nuclear program before September 2025 appear low, with only three months remaining until the deadline. The fundamental obstacle is the irreconcilable positions on uranium enrichment, with the US demanding a complete halt to enrichment while Iran considers this a non-negotiable red line.

## Current State of Negotiations

Since April 2025, the US and Iran have completed five rounds of negotiations, with the most recent talks in Rome ending without an agreement. These represent the highest level of engagement between the two countries since the US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, after which Iran began breaching the agreement's provisions in 2019.

The primary point of contention remains Iran's uranium enrichment program:
- The US position, articulated by multiple officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is that Iran must completely halt all uranium enrichment activities
- Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has explicitly stated: "Zero nuclear weapons equals a deal. Zero enrichment equals no deal"
- Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has dismissed calls to end uranium enrichment as "excessive and outrageous"

## Key Obstacles to an Agreement

Several factors make reaching an agreement within the next three months particularly challenging:

1. **Fundamental disagreement on uranium enrichment**: The US demand for zero enrichment directly conflicts with Iran's position that enrichment is a sovereign right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

2. **Limited progress despite multiple rounds**: After five rounds of talks, the parties have achieved only minimal progress on core issues, suggesting resolution remains distant.

3. **Tight timeframe**: With approximately three months remaining before the September deadline, the window for resolving such fundamental disagreements is narrow, especially considering the 2015 JCPOA took years to negotiate.

4. **Trust deficit**: Iran's experience with the US withdrawal from the 2015 deal makes it less likely to trust that any new agreement will be honored, increasing Tehran's insistence on maintaining enrichment capabilities as insurance.

5. **European pressure**: European signatories have warned Iran that if a "meaningful" nuclear deal is not reached by August, they will trigger the snapback mechanism to reimpose UN sanctions, which could harden Iran's position.

## Potential Pathways to Agreement

Despite these obstacles, certain factors could facilitate an agreement:

1. **Economic pressure**: Sanctions have severely impacted Iran's economy, potentially increasing Tehran's incentive to reach a deal that includes sanctions relief.

2. **Interim agreement possibility**: The US has proposed an initial agreement where Iran would demonstrate readiness to permanently abandon pursuit of nuclear weapons, with the US considering postponing certain sanctions.

3. **External pressures**: The threat of military action, particularly from Israel, creates urgency to reach a diplomatic solution.

4. **Historical precedent**: The 2015 JCPOA negotiations only progressed after the US acknowledged that Iran could retain uranium enrichment capacity. If the current administration shows similar flexibility, progress might be possible.

## Likelihood Assessment

The status quo clearly points toward no agreement by September 2025. The fundamental disagreement over uranium enrichment has persisted through five rounds of talks with no indication of compromise from either side. Iran has explicitly stated it will not accept a deal without enrichment rights, while the US maintains that Iran must halt all enrichment.

National Security Advisor Michael Waltz has stated that Iran must "give up their entire [nuclear] program" as part of any deal. This position appears incompatible with Iran's firm stance on maintaining enrichment capabilities.

The three-month timeframe is extremely short for resolving such entrenched differences, particularly given the complex technical and political considerations involved. Even if an interim framework were to emerge, drafting, finalizing, and signing a formal agreement that satisfies both parties' core demands would be challenging within this timeline.

While external pressures and economic incentives create some motivation for agreement, the history of US-Iran negotiations suggests that major breakthroughs rarely occur without clear evidence of movement on core positions. Currently, both sides remain firmly entrenched on the enrichment issue.

International negotiations on Iran's nuclear program have historically evolved slowly and are often derailed by entrenched positions and domestic considerations. The most likely outcome appears to be either continued negotiations beyond the September deadline or a collapse of talks without a formal agreement.

Given these factors, the probability of the United States and Iran signing an agreement restricting Iran's nuclear program before September 2025 is low, estimated at approximately 20-25%.
