H5 avian influenza remains primarily a threat to animal health, with global circulation among wild birds and poultry and a notable recent expansion into mammalian species, including livestock and companion animals. In 2024, outbreaks in mammals more than doubled compared to the previous year, spanning 55 countries. This broader host range increases the virus's evolutionary opportunities, but, as of mid-2025, it has not acquired mutations that would facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission.

Human infections continue to occur sporadically and are almost exclusively linked to direct contact with infected animals. In 2024, there were 81 confirmed human cases—the highest annual total since 2015—with isolated severe outcomes, such as a child fatality in Mexico and a death in the United States. Nonetheless, the overall case fatality rate in recent years appears much lower than during earlier H5N1 waves, and there is no evidence of unexplained clusters or community transmission.

Globally, the economic and agricultural impact of H5 outbreaks has been substantial, including the loss of millions of poultry and significant trade disruptions—evident in Brazil’s first major outbreak in a commercial farm and subsequent export restrictions. While these factors contribute to regional instability in food supply and commerce, they do not, on their own, meet the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which is primarily focused on risks to human health and international spread among people.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and other authorities continue to classify the risk to the general public as “low,” and “low to moderate” for those occupationally exposed to infected animals. This assessment is informed by: 
- absence of sustained human-to-human transmission,
- lack of new genetic adaptations facilitating efficient human infection,
- continued sporadic nature of human cases,
- and manageable outbreaks with existing surveillance and control measures.

A PHEIC declaration under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) requires evidence that an event is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected, presents a public health risk beyond national borders, and may necessitate immediate international action. Past PHEIC declarations, such as for COVID-19 and mpox, have involved clear human-to-human transmission, rapid international propagation, and substantial health impact—conditions not currently mirrored by the H5 avian influenza situation.

While the ongoing increase in mammalian infections represents a rising concern for potential viral adaptation, and while the possibility of a sudden epidemiological shift cannot be ruled out, the trajectory to date has been gradual, and no “threshold-crossing” event has been detected. The most plausible catalyst for a PHEIC declaration before 2026 would be the emergence of efficient human-to-human transmission, marked by unexplained clusters or a surge in severe human cases across multiple countries. In the absence of such developments, and considering the status quo of decades of H5N1 circulation without a PHEIC, the likelihood remains low that the WHO will declare a PHEIC for H5 avian influenza before 2026. However, the dynamic nature of the situation warrants continued close surveillance and preparedness for rapid international response should the risk profile change.
