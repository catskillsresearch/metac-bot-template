The current landscape for Bitcoin as legal tender is characterized by a cautious and limited adoption, with only the Central African Republic maintaining its status after El Salvador's repeal. The prevailing trend suggests that without significant changes, the number of countries recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender is likely to remain at one. This is largely due to the lack of momentum for additional adoptions and the increasing focus on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which are seen as more stable and controllable alternatives by many governments.

Experts and market analysts generally predict a low probability of substantial change in this area. The consensus is that the number of countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender by 2030 will likely remain between one and three. This expectation is influenced by ongoing regulatory scrutiny and concerns over financial stability, money laundering, and the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies.

However, unexpected scenarios could alter this trajectory. A global regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies could lead to the Central African Republic reversing its decision, resulting in no countries recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender. Conversely, a significant geopolitical or economic event, such as hyperinflation or a major financial crisis, could prompt several countries, particularly those with unstable economies, to adopt Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation. This could lead to a rapid increase in the number of countries recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, potentially reaching five or more.
