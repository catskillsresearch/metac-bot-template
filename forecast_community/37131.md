# Will any MLB player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?

As of May 20, 2025, Aaron Judge stands as the only MLB player with a batting average above .400, currently hitting .401-.402. His closest competitor, Freddie Freeman, trails significantly at .371-.375, creating a substantial 30-point gap between Judge and his nearest challenger. This positions Judge as the lone realistic candidate to maintain a .400+ average by July 1, with only 41 days remaining until that benchmark date.

## Historical Context and Difficulty

The .400 batting average represents one of baseball's most elusive achievements. No player has finished a season hitting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941, a drought spanning over 80 years. Even sustaining such an average into the summer months has proven extraordinarily difficult for modern players. This historical pattern strongly suggests that batting averages at this extreme level tend to regress downward as the season progresses.

## Judge's Current Performance

Judge's 2025 season has been historically impressive. Beyond his MLB-leading batting average, he's demonstrating comprehensive offensive dominance:
- Leading in key metrics including on-base percentage (.490), slugging percentage (.751), and OPS
- Showing elite power with consistent hard contact
- Maintaining superior plate discipline

However, there are clear regression indicators. Judge's batting average on balls in play (BABIP) sits at .481, substantially above his career norm of approximately .344. This suggests he has benefited from some statistical fortune that may not continue.

## Factors Affecting Sustainability

Several elements will influence whether Judge can maintain this pace for another 41 days:

**Against Sustainability:**
- Statistical regression is highly likely given his inflated BABIP
- Pitcher adjustments typically occur as the season progresses
- Even brief slumps can quickly drop a .400 average below the threshold
- Physical fatigue becomes more prominent deeper into the season
- The sheer difficulty of the achievementâ€”no player has sustained this level through July in decades

**Supporting Sustainability:**
- Judge has already maintained this pace for nearly two months
- His lead gives him some buffer against minor cold streaks
- His fundamental hitting approach appears sound, not purely luck-based
- A few multi-hit games could offset brief struggles
- He only needs to maintain for approximately 35-40 more games, not a full season

## Other Contenders

The gap between Judge and other hitters is substantial. Freddie Freeman at .371-.375 would need an improbable hot streak to reach .400 by July 1. No other player is positioned to make a realistic run at this mark given the current standings and the limited time remaining.

## Weighing the Evidence

While Judge's current state suggests the possibility of maintaining a .400+ average, baseball history and statistical principles heavily favor regression. His underlying metrics, particularly his unsustainably high BABIP, point toward some correction. The 41-day timeframe represents both an advantage (shorter than a full season) and challenge (long enough for slumps or regression to manifest).

The status quo leans toward Judge having a chance, as he has already sustained this performance longer than most .400 hitters in recent decades. However, the overwhelming historical pattern is that even exceptional early-season averages eventually fall below .400 as the season progresses.

Looking at the balance between Judge's demonstrated skill, current buffer above .400, and the strong statistical and historical indicators suggesting regression, there appears to be approximately a 35% probability that at least one MLB player (almost certainly Judge) will have a batting average of .400 or higher on July 1, 2025.
