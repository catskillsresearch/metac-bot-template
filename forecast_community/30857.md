Several factors shape the prospects for repeal or curtailment of major components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before 2026.

Republican control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress has created a legislative environment where significant changes to the ACA are more achievable than in recent years. House Republicans have introduced broad repeal legislation, such as H.R.114, which would repeal the ACA and related statutes effective at the start of fiscal year 2026, signaling clear intent to target the law’s foundations. In addition, recent budget reconciliation proposals include substantial Medicaid cuts—about $880 billion over ten years—with measures such as stricter work and eligibility requirements, reductions in federal funding for Medicaid expansion, and restrictions on federal funding for non-citizens.

Enhanced premium tax credits, a critical component of ACA coverage expansion, are already set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts to extend them. The Congressional Budget Office projects a sharp drop in Marketplace enrollment if these enhanced subsidies are not renewed. This expiration, together with possible legislative action to further restrict premium tax credits and tighten eligibility, puts multiple core components of the ACA at risk.

Despite the apparent opportunity for significant change, several constraints persist. Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, requiring the use of budget reconciliation—a process restricted to provisions affecting federal spending or revenue and still subject to party unity, especially among moderate Republicans wary of cutting popular healthcare benefits. Internal divisions have repeatedly stymied ACA repeal in the past, as in the unsuccessful 2017 effort, and some current Republican legislators have expressed skepticism about deep Medicaid cuts.

Public opinion further limits the scope of feasible change. The ACA has reached peak popularity, with record Marketplace enrollment and widespread reliance on Medicaid expansion, making sweeping rollbacks politically perilous. States have responded to continued uncertainty by exploring state-level protections, and several Republican senators highlight the political risks of healthcare cuts amid ongoing debates about extending expiring tax provisions.

Regulatory actions offer another pathway for the administration to tighten eligibility or reduce improper enrollment, but such changes do not amount to statutory repeal or curtailment under the criteria for major ACA rollback. Only new federal legislation altering at least three major ACA components would constitute a true repeal or curtailment.

Budget reconciliation remains the likeliest vehicle for legislative action, potentially bundling Medicaid cuts, premium subsidy reductions, and employer mandate changes with broader tax priorities. However, the status quo bias is strong: major health programs with substantial public support have historically proven resilient against rapid or wholesale repeal, and procedural obstacles or intra-party divisions may dilute or delay any final package.

In summary, while there is renewed legislative energy and a clear pathway for Republicans to target at least three major ACA components, formidable political, procedural, and public opinion barriers must still be overcome. The fate of these efforts remains highly contingent on party unity, Senate dynamics, and the legislative calendar, with late 2025 as a critical window for any potential changes.
