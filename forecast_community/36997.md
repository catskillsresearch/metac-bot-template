Anthropic has consistently focused on securing substantial private funding and building strategic partnerships rather than preparing for a public offering. In recent months, the company completed a major $3.5 billion funding round at a $61.5 billion valuation, following massive investments from technology giants such as Amazon and Google, which together have committed over $10 billion. This strong private capital position removes the immediate financial pressure that frequently drives companies toward an IPO.

The broader AI market showcases a similar trend, with leading peers like OpenAI also remaining private despite their high valuations, and most AI startups appearing to target IPOs beyond 2025. The overall IPO environment has been described as sluggish, and there are no credible reports of Anthropic undertaking preparatory actions typical for a public offering—such as selecting investment bankers, filing a confidential S-1 form, or making public statements about plans to access public markets. These steps are usually seen several months ahead of an official IPO announcement, making a move within the short window before July 1, 2025, less likely.

Additionally, Anthropic’s recent operational focus has been on accelerating product development and international expansion, illustrated by releases like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and new market entries, rather than activities aligned with imminent public market entry. The company’s structure as a public benefit corporation may also influence the timing of a potential IPO, possibly prompting a more cautious approach due to its mission-driven mandate.

Given the absence of pre-IPO signals, the ongoing influx of private capital, and clear indications from industry trackers that Anthropic is not preparing for an IPO in the near term, it appears the company will maintain its current private status at least until after July 1, 2025. While an unforeseen shift in market sentiment or strategy could always accelerate plans, all current evidence strongly supports the expectation that no IPO announcement is imminent.
