Ukraine’s presidential election remains unannounced, with martial law still firmly in effect and no credible signs of imminent change. Ukrainian law explicitly prohibits holding or announcing a presidential election while martial law is active, a restriction repeatedly reaffirmed by both President Zelenskyy and parliament. The legal and political consensus—backed by multiple authoritative statements—is that elections can only be considered after martial law is lifted, a step contingent on a substantial improvement in security, such as a ceasefire or a durable peace agreement.

As of mid-May 2025, there are no credible reports or official movements toward lifting martial law or preparing for an election. Ukrainian authorities, including the president’s office, have publicly and emphatically denied rumors or media speculation suggesting that a presidential election announcement is imminent or being planned for the near term. The government’s position is also shaped by practical and societal concerns: conducting an election during active conflict poses severe risks to national security, could weaken the country’s unity, and is widely opposed by the Ukrainian public. Polling suggests very little public support for wartime elections, and parliament recently passed a resolution reaffirming Zelenskyy’s legitimacy and the legal impossibility of elections during ongoing hostilities.

External pressure—including calls from some U.S. officials and Russian information campaigns—exists, but Ukraine’s leadership and public remain firm in prioritizing security and legal stability over electoral timelines. The only plausible way a presidential election could be announced before July 1, 2025, would require a sudden and extraordinary breakthrough—such as a rapid truce and the immediate lifting of martial law—none of which is currently underway or anticipated. All available evidence and recent government actions indicate a continuation of the status quo, making an announcement before July 1 extremely unlikely barring unforeseeable, dramatic change.
