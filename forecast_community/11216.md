Ron DeSantis’s path to the U.S. presidency by January 20, 2029 would require a dramatic comeback following significant setbacks. After a failed 2024 presidential campaign, in which he dropped out early and endorsed Donald Trump, DeSantis’s national profile diminished and his standing within the Republican Party fell behind rising contenders like JD Vance, who has consistently led in early 2028 polling—often by wide margins, with DeSantis polling in the single digits at 6–10% depending on the scenario. DeSantis himself has neither committed to nor ruled out a 2028 presidential run, instead signaling an openness to future national ambitions while focusing on state-level politics and positioning his wife, Casey DeSantis, for Florida’s 2026 gubernatorial race, which has drawn a competing endorsement from Trump for Byron Donalds, underscoring ongoing tensions with the party’s dominant figure.

DeSantis retains a measure of political influence as Florida’s governor. He has continued to pursue a conservative legislative agenda, such as recognizing gold and silver as legal tender and enacting measures to limit state contracts with “countries of concern.” These efforts burnish his credentials within the party’s base, but his national reputation suffered from his 2024 campaign, which was widely criticized for infighting, poor messaging, and organizational disarray.

Historically, some presidential hopefuls recover from failed bids—Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are notable examples—while others fade from contention. DeSantis’s young age (he would be 50 in 2028), his statewide political network, and any success by his wife in Florida politics could provide him opportunities for political rehabilitation. However, the combination of poor early polling, unresolved tensions with Trump and his base, and the emergence of formidable rivals sets a high bar for any comeback effort. Additionally, DeSantis is not currently in the federal line of succession, making pathways to the presidency outside the 2028 election or a major ticket role exceedingly improbable.

The likelihood of DeSantis becoming president by 2029 hinges on several critical uncertainties: whether he can repair his standing with Trump-aligned voters, outmaneuver better-positioned rivals like JD Vance, rebuild his campaign infrastructure and fundraising network, and reestablish broad national appeal after a significant early setback. While such political turnarounds are possible, the current trajectory, informed by both polling and party dynamics, indicates a challenging and unlikely road to the presidency within this timeframe.
