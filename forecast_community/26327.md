As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I'll address the question about measles cases in the United States for 2025 based on the available information.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known when the CDC publishes its first update showing the total number of reported cases through the end of 2025. Given that we're currently in May 2025, we'll likely see this final tally in January or February 2026, so approximately 8-9 months from now.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
Based on the search results, there have already been 1,001 confirmed measles cases in 2025 as of the most recent reporting.[1] This suggests that even if the rate of new cases suddenly stopped, the final count would be at least 1,001 cases.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The current data shows we've reached 1,001 cases by early May 2025.[1] If this trend continues at a similar pace for the remainder of the year, we could expect approximately 2,400-2,800 total cases by year-end.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Public health officials appear concerned about the rapid spread, noting that measles is highly contagious and that a 2.5% change in vaccination rates could mean thousands more cases.[2] The WHO reported in March that the hospitalization rate was 17%, with most cases occurring in unvaccinated children.[4] This suggests experts anticipate continued growth in case numbers.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected massive public health intervention with emergency vaccination campaigns targeting outbreak areas could dramatically slow transmission. If authorities implement strict quarantine measures and successfully vaccinate vulnerable populations in response to the current outbreaks, the case count might stabilize around 1,200-1,500 total for the year.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
If the virus reaches multiple densely populated areas with low vaccination rates simultaneously, we could see exponential growth in cases. The highly contagious nature of measles (remaining infectious in the air for up to 2 hours)[3] combined with increased travel during summer and holiday seasons could lead to widespread transmission across multiple states, potentially pushing the total well above 3,000 cases.

Looking at the evidence, I need to be humble in my assessment. The current data shows we've already reached 1,001 cases by early May,[1] which is concerning given that we're not even halfway through the year. The growth rate has been significant, from 222 cases in early March[3] to 378 cases by late March[4] to over 1,000 cases by early May.[1] This demonstrates accelerating spread.

I must also consider that 2019 saw 1,274 total cases,[5] and we've nearly matched that in just the first 4-5 months of 2025. The presence of 14 distinct outbreaks reported so far this year[1] suggests multiple transmission chains that could continue to grow.
