The next crewed lunar landing is most likely to follow established patterns, as the United States has decades of human spaceflight experience and a well-developed infrastructure that puts its Artemis program at an advantage. Despite recent delays and financial challenges, the U.S. record in overcoming technical setbacks favors continued progress under “business-as‐usual” conditions. In contrast, China is pursuing a methodical, politically coordinated approach with ambitious targets for its crewed lunar missions. Although China’s program is making steady progress, its crewed lunar landing hardware is relatively unproven, and key technical and budgetary hurdles remain.

If current trajectories persist, the U.S. will likely resolve its issues and achieve a timely landing, reinforcing the expectation based on historical precedent. However, should significant delays or setbacks further impede the Artemis mission, China’s steady build‐up and focused planning could allow its mission to advance more swiftly. Given these dynamics, while both nations face uncertainties, the weight of historical experience and existing infrastructure points to the U.S. taking the lead—unless unforeseen disruptions materially alter the pace of progress in either program.
