The time remaining until the outcome is known is approximately 2 years and 7 months, leading up to January 1, 2028. As of June 2025, there are over 7,500 operational Starlink satellites. If no further launches or deorbiting occurred, this would be the status quo outcome.

Currently, SpaceX is maintaining a rapid launch cadence, and if this trend continues while accounting for satellite attrition, the number of operational satellites could reach between 11,000 and 17,000 by early 2028. This projection aligns with expert and market expectations, as reflected in the Metaculus community median forecast of around 11,100 operational satellites, with a 25th–75th percentile range of about 7,100–17,100. Independent analyses support a similar range, assuming the continuation of current launch and attrition rates.

However, several unexpected scenarios could impact these projections. A significant regulatory change or a major technical failure with the Starship rocket could drastically reduce the number of launches, resulting in fewer operational satellites. Additionally, increased solar activity or geomagnetic storms could lead to higher attrition rates, further lowering the count.

Conversely, if SpaceX successfully accelerates its launch cadence with the Starship rocket and experiences lower-than-expected attrition rates, the number of operational satellites could exceed current forecasts, potentially reaching closer to 20,000. This optimistic scenario hinges on SpaceX's ability to scale up its operations and maintain satellite health effectively.
