The timeline for the development and public demonstration of the first AGI remains uncertain, with the possibility of it being years or even decades away. Currently, the landscape suggests that for-profit corporations are more likely to develop the first AGI due to their substantial resources, funding, and computational power, which are critical for such an endeavor. Companies like OpenAI and DeepMind have the expertise and resources to potentially achieve AGI independently, without significant collaboration with universities.

However, universities bring significant strengths to the table, particularly in fundamental research and interdisciplinary collaboration. These strengths could be crucial in the development of AGI, especially if a university's research breakthroughs or unique expertise play a pivotal role. The increasing trend of cross-institutional collaborations further suggests that universities could be involved in a joint effort to develop AGI. Such collaborations could see universities contributing their research capabilities while corporations provide the necessary computational resources and funding.

In summary, while the current status quo leans towards corporations due to their resource advantages, the potential for university involvement through collaborative efforts cannot be ignored. The landscape of AGI research is dynamic, and the possibility of a university playing a significant role in the development of the first AGI remains plausible, particularly in a collaborative model.
