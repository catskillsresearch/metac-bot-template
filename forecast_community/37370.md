# Comprehensive Rationale on GameStop's 2025 Annual Meeting

Based on available information, GameStop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is officially scheduled for Thursday, June 12, 2025, at 10:00 AM Central Daylight Time. The meeting will be held in a virtual-only format, meaning stockholders will not be able to attend in person.

The timing of this meeting follows typical corporate patterns, with mid-June being a common timeframe for annual stockholder meetings. GameStop has already published its 2025 proxy statement, which includes formal notice of the upcoming meeting.

At the meeting, stockholders will be asked to:
1. Elect five directors to serve on the board until the next annual meeting
2. Provide an advisory non-binding vote on executive compensation
3. Ratify the audit committee's decisions

## Historical Context and Risk Assessment

It's worth noting that GameStop experienced significant technical difficulties during its 2024 annual meeting. Server issues caused by overwhelming attendance forced the company to reschedule that meeting. This precedent establishes a real, if limited, risk for the 2025 meeting.

However, given that GameStop and its meeting platform providers have had a full year to address these capacity and stability issues, it's reasonable to expect they've implemented significant improvements to prevent a recurrence. The company is likely to have increased server capacity and implemented additional technical safeguards after last year's incident.

## Recent Developments

GameStop has made several significant announcements in early 2025, including updating its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This move has generated renewed interest in the company, with the related GME memecoin jumping 50% on this Bitcoin adoption news. This increased attention could potentially affect meeting attendance levels.

The company has also engaged in other significant corporate activities, such as proposing a private offering of convertible senior notes. These activities suggest normal corporate functioning, with no indication of any planned changes to the scheduled meeting date.

## Technical Considerations

The meeting is being hosted through Computershare's virtual meeting platform. As of May 27, 2025, the meeting portal indicates that "The meeting is currently not open to attend online," which is expected given that the meeting is still more than two weeks away.

For the meeting to successfully occur on June 12, the virtual platform must function properly throughout the entire session, allowing for all scheduled business to be conducted without adjournment or postponement. Given the preparations likely made after last year's difficulties, there is a reasonable expectation that the meeting will proceed as scheduled.
