# Measles in Texas: Projecting Case Counts to July 1, 2025

As of May 21, 2025, Texas has reported 722 confirmed measles cases in an outbreak that began in late January. With 41 days remaining until July 1, several key factors will influence the final case count.

## Current Situation Analysis

The measles outbreak in Texas has shown significant deceleration in recent weeks. Only 4 new cases were reported between May 16 and May 20, representing the lowest weekly increase since February. This dramatic slowdown follows a period of more substantial spread earlier in the outbreak, when health officials warned that case counts could potentially exceed 1,000 by early summer if exponential growth continued.

The outbreak has been heavily concentrated in West Texas, with Gaines County accounting for 406 cases (56% of the total). Since the beginning, approximately 90 people have been hospitalized, and tragically, two unvaccinated school-aged children have died.

## Trend Analysis and Projection

The current trajectory shows a clear pattern of deceleration:
- Recent weekly increases have been in the single digits
- The most recent reporting period showed only 4 new cases
- The current rate of new infections is approximately 1-2 cases per week

If this trend continues for the next 41 days, we would expect an additional 6-12 cases by July 1. This would result in a total case count of approximately 728-734.

## Key Factors Affecting the Projection

Several critical elements will influence the final case count:

**Factors supporting continued deceleration:**
- Public health interventions appear to be effectively containing the spread
- Less than 1% of confirmed cases are currently "actively infectious"
- Measles has some seasonality, with spring typically being a peak period, suggesting the natural cycle may help reduce transmission moving into summer
- Vaccination efforts targeting under-vaccinated communities may further limit transmission

**Risk factors for potential increases:**
- The possibility of new outbreaks in under-vaccinated communities remains
- Summer travel and large gatherings could create superspreader events
- Reporting lags might result in sudden increases as previously undetected cases are confirmed
- The highly contagious nature of measles means even a single case in a vulnerable population could trigger a new cluster

## Scenario Analysis

**Low-end scenario (722-725 cases):**
A complete containment of the outbreak could occur if all transmission chains end abruptly, enhanced vaccination campaigns prove immediately effective, or reporting delays overtake the actual infection rate. In this scenario, virtually no new cases would be reported between now and July 1.

**Most likely scenario (728-740 cases):**
The current deceleration trend continues with minimal new cases reported weekly. Public health measures remain effective, and no significant new clusters emerge. This represents a steady but very slow growth in total cases.

**High-end scenario (750+ cases):**
A superspreader event, new outbreak in an under-vaccinated community, or significant underreporting suddenly coming to light could drive a new surge in cases. Summer travel or large gatherings could accelerate transmission. In this scenario, dozens of new cases might emerge rapidly, potentially pushing the total above 760 or even approaching 800 in extreme circumstances.

The overwhelming evidence suggests that the outbreak has entered a containment phase, with the most probable outcome being a total of 728-740 cases by July 1, barring any unexpected developments.
