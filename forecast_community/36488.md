(a) Time left until outcome is known: Approximately 7 months (from May 9, 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: The domestic content requirements remain optional for obtaining the ITC, continuing to function as a bonus credit rather than a mandatory requirement.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Congress fails to pass legislation making domestic content requirements mandatory, possibly due to the slim Republican majority in the House, resistance from moderate Republicans concerned about phasing out clean energy incentives, or disagreements about implementation.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Republicans successfully pass budget reconciliation legislation that modifies the IRA to make domestic content requirements mandatory for obtaining the ITC, possibly as part of broader changes to federal energy policy.

Based on the current information available, I need to assess whether domestic content requirements will become mandatory for obtaining the IRA's Investment Tax Credits (48E) by January 1, 2026.

Looking at the most recent evidence, there is no indication that domestic content requirements have become mandatory as of May 2025. The IRS issued Notice 2025-08 on January 16, 2025, which provides updated guidance regarding domestic content requirements, but maintains them as optional bonus credits rather than mandatory requirements[1]. This notice represents the third guidance document from the IRS on this topic, following Notice 2023-38 and Notice 2024-41, all of which have treated domestic content as an optional bonus rather than a requirement[1].

The domestic content bonus credit remains available to taxpayers who certify that their qualified facility, energy project, or energy storage technology meets certain domestic manufacturing criteria, but it is not required to claim the base ITC[2]. Current IRS guidance maintains the rate of domestic content required to qualify for the bonus at 40% for 2025[5].

For the domestic content requirements to become mandatory, Congress would need to pass legislation amending the ITC provisions. While Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House, several factors make this change less likely:

1. The Republican majority in the House is extremely slim (220-213), requiring near-unanimous support for any partisan legislation.

2. A group of 21 Republican representatives has expressed support for phasing out rather than eliminating clean energy incentives, suggesting internal party division on how to approach IRA modifications[5].

3. The House Speaker has indicated a measured approach ("somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer") rather than wholesale repeal of IRA provisions.

4. Making domestic content requirements mandatory would represent a significant policy shift that could face resistance from industry stakeholders who have already made investment decisions based on the current optional structure.

5. The focus of Republican tax changes appears to be more on extending Trump-era tax cuts rather than specifically targeting IRA energy provisions.

While the budget reconciliation process provides a pathway for Republicans to make changes to the IRA with a simple majority, the specific change of making domestic content requirements mandatory does not appear to be a stated priority in current legislative discussions. The Treasury Department and IRS continue to refine implementation of the existing bonus structure rather than signaling a shift toward mandatory requirements[4][5].

It's worth noting that there is still time for legislation to be enacted before January 1, 2026, and political priorities can shift quickly. However, given the lack of specific momentum toward making domestic content requirements mandatory, the slim congressional majorities, and the complexity of passing major tax legislation, the status quo appears more likely to persist.

Probability: 25%
