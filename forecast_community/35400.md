(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 19 days until the end of 2025, after which the question would resolve as "Not before 2026" if no bilateral ceasefire is implemented.

(b) Status quo outcome: No bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement implemented. Russia and Ukraine continue fighting with no formal cessation of hostilities.

(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: The planned Istanbul talks on May 15 produce a breakthrough that neither side anticipated. Under pressure from Turkey and facing domestic economic challenges, Putin agrees to a modified 30-day ceasefire as a confidence-building measure, which goes into effect on June 1, 2025, with both sides agreeing to monitoring mechanisms.

## Current State of Peace Negotiations

The Russia-Ukraine conflict is at a potential inflection point regarding peace negotiations, with direct bilateral talks scheduled for May 15, 2025, in Istanbul, Turkey. This represents the first high-level direct engagement between the two sides in over three years[1][2].

President Zelensky has accepted Putin's invitation to meet in Turkey and stated he will "personally wait for Putin" there[1]. Meanwhile, Turkish President Erdogan has expressed support for resuming talks and noted that a comprehensive ceasefire would "create the necessary environment" for productive negotiations[1].

## Key Points of Contention

Several fundamental disagreements make a near-term ceasefire challenging:

1. **Ceasefire Preconditions**: Ukraine, supported by European leaders, insists on an immediate 30-day comprehensive ceasefire before substantive negotiations[1][2]. Russia has rejected this sequencing, with Russian officials stating Putin "clearly stated that first, we need to discuss the root causes, and then we can talk about a ceasefire."

2. **Basis for Negotiations**: Putin wants to base talks on the 2022 Istanbul protocols, which included terms that would effectively amount to Ukrainian surrender[1]. These maximalist demands are unlikely to be accepted by Ukraine.

3. **Military Realities**: Both sides continue active combat operations, with recent advances reported in various sectors[1]. Neither side appears militarily defeated enough to accept unfavorable terms.

## Forecasting the Timeline

Looking at the possible implementation of a bilateral ceasefire:

**1 January - 31 March 2025 (0%)**: This period has already passed without a ceasefire agreement.

**1 April - 30 June 2025 (15%)**: The upcoming Istanbul talks represent the most promising opportunity in years for direct negotiations. If both sides feel sufficient pressure, a short-term ceasefire could be implemented in late May or June as a confidence-building measure. However, the fundamental gap between Russian and Ukrainian positions makes this unlikely. Russia's insistence on discussing "root causes" before a ceasefire suggests they will not agree quickly to terms acceptable to Ukraine.

**1 July - 30 September 2025 (25%)**: If the Istanbul talks produce a framework for continued negotiations, this timeframe could see more concrete progress. Summer fighting seasons historically create pressure for diplomatic solutions as casualties mount. The extended timeline would allow for the development of monitoring mechanisms for a ceasefire, which both sides might find necessary.

**1 October - 31 December 2025 (20%)**: If earlier negotiations stall but don't collapse entirely, autumn and winter could provide another window for agreement. Seasonal factors (harsher winter conditions) might increase incentives for a ceasefire. Year-end political considerations might also drive leaders to seek diplomatic achievements.

**Not before 2026 (40%)**: This remains the most likely outcome. The gulf between Russian and Ukrainian positions appears too wide to bridge in the short term. Putin's continued insistence on Ukrainian capitulation and Ukraine's resistance to territorial concessions create a fundamental impasse. The history of failed ceasefires and peace initiatives since 2022 suggests that the status quo of continued conflict is likely to persist.

## Key Factors That Could Change This Assessment

1. **Turkish Mediation**: Erdogan's active involvement could potentially bridge some gaps, especially if he can offer both sides face-saving compromises.

2. **US Pressure**: The Trump administration's approach to the conflict could significantly influence both sides' willingness to compromise.

3. **Battlefield Developments**: Major victories or defeats could shift bargaining positions unexpectedly.

4. **Domestic Politics**: Internal pressure within Russia or Ukraine could force leaders to accept terms they previously rejected.
