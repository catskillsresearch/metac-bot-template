(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
About 7 months remain until December 2025, when the outcome of the question will be determined.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If trends as of May 2025 continue, the outcome would be "Yes"—transformer-derived architectures will still be considered state-of-the-art for language modeling in December 2025. Current LLMs dominating both research and production (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Mistral, Llama) overwhelmingly use transformer-based architectures or clear derivatives[1][2][3][5].

(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A "No" outcome would require a disruptive new architecture—not derived from the transformer and not citing Vaswani et al. (2017) as a chief inspiration—to achieve state-of-the-art results on major language modeling tasks, and for this to be widely acknowledged in 2025 publications and benchmarks. For example, if models based on state space models (e.g., Mamba), neural long-term memory systems (e.g., Titans), or some as-yet-unpublicized architecture demonstrated clear, repeated, and peer-reviewed superiority, appearing as “state of the art” in at least three of the top five 2025 Google Scholar results or as the new leader on the WikiText-2 benchmark, the answer would be "No." As of May 2025, while promising, these alternatives remain experimental or complementary rather than dominant.

(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
The dominant trend persists: transformer-based (or hybrid transformer-derivative) models continue to win or lead language modeling benchmarks. Scholarly and industrial publications in 2025 keep reporting state-of-the-art results using architectures that are unambiguously transformer-derived, citing Vaswani et al. (2017) as their foundation. WikiText-2 and other high-profile benchmarks are led by such architectures. Research into alternatives—like Mamba, Titans, or state-space models—either fails to displace transformers broadly or results in hybrid systems that still clearly fall under the “transformer-derived” definition, thus fulfilling the criteria for a "Yes" resolution.

## Rationale

- **Current Dominance:** Transformers have been the backbone of every major leap in large language models since 2017, and as of May 2025, all leading models (by both traffic and benchmark results) are transformer-derived[1][2][3].
- **Incremental Change:** The AI research community historically moves incrementally, with dominant architectures often retaining SOTA for years, even as enhancements and partial competitors emerge.
- **No Disruptive Successor Yet Visible:** Although new architectures like Mamba and Titans are being developed and show promise, there is no evidence they have, as of now, unseated transformers on leading language modeling benchmarks or in the scholarly consensus[3].
- **Resolution Criteria Favors Transformer Continuity:** Because the criteria require only 2 of 5 top 2025 Google Scholar papers or the top WikiText-2 benchmark entry to use a transformer-derived model, and given the conservatism of benchmark and publication practices, a rapid, broad transition away from transformers within 7 months is highly unlikely.
- **Expert and Industry Sentiment:** Industry and academic commentary in 2025 still overwhelmingly consider transformer derivatives the foundation of the field[1][2][3].

## Final Probability

Probability: 92%

This reflects a very high likelihood that, come December 2025, transformer-derived architectures will still meet the resolution criteria for "state-of-the-art" in language modeling. The probability is not set higher only to account for the slim, but nonzero, chance of extraordinary breakthroughs or surprisingly fast adoption of a radically new architecture before year’s end.
