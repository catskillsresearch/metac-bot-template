## Rationale for the Likelihood of Kneecap Performing at Glastonbury 2025

Kneecap is currently scheduled to perform at Glastonbury 2025, as confirmed by official lineup announcements for both the main festival and stage-specific slots such as Shangri-La and West Holts, with no indication of removal by the organizers as of late May 2025. The default expectation, in festival operations, is that listed acts perform unless a significant intervening event arises.

The band faces unprecedented scrutiny due to a recent terrorism-related charge against member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (Mo Chara), stemming from an alleged incident involving a Hezbollah flag at a November 2024 performance. The legal case is ongoing, with a critical court appearance scheduled for June 18, just one week prior to Glastonbury. While the band asserts its intention to fight the charge, this legal process introduces a substantial element of uncertainty. Should the court impose conditions restricting travel or public performances, or if a conviction occurs, the band’s ability to play could be directly impeded.

Political and public pressure is mounting. Several UK politicians, including a Cabinet minister and multiple MPs, have openly called for Kneecap’s removal from the lineup. Some have made formal appeals to Glastonbury’s organizers, and there is widespread media coverage of the controversy. The organizers have, however, maintained a policy of silence or non-intervention up to this point, reflecting Glastonbury’s history of supporting controversial acts and resisting external demands to censor their program.

Recent developments show both risk and resilience. Kneecap performed at the Wide Awake Festival in London in late May 2025, even after charges were filed, which indicates the absence of an immediate legal prohibition on their performances in the UK. However, the band has already been dropped from other festivals, including events in Germany and the Eden Sessions in Cornwall, which demonstrates that other organizers have capitulated under similar pressure.

The band has been candid with fans, repeatedly warning that their Glastonbury slot “hangs in the balance” and is “in jeopardy,” underscoring the seriousness of the situation from the inside. The June 18 court date is a pivotal point—any adverse legal development could force a last-minute cancelation.

In summary, while the default expectation is that Kneecap will perform as planned, the combination of serious legal jeopardy, ongoing police investigations, intense political pressure, and recent precedents of removal from other festivals has created substantial uncertainty. The situation is highly fluid: unless the organizers or authorities intervene—especially following the upcoming court hearing—the most likely outcome remains a Yes. However, the band’s own statements and the timing of legal proceedings make a last-minute reversal a credible risk.
