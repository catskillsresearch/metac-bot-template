# East African Federation Ratification Prospects: 2025-2030

The East African Federation (EAF) represents an ambitious vision to unite the East African Community (EAC) member states - Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda - into a single federated sovereign state. As of June 2025, while the process is active, no country has formally ratified an agreement to merge into a federated state. With 4.5 years remaining until the end of 2029, I'll examine the likelihood that three countries will ratify such an agreement by 2030.

## Current Status of the Federation Process

The constitutional drafting process for the East African Federation is currently underway but moving slower than originally planned. In May 2023, the drafting process resumed with a 20-day consultation with local stakeholders in Kenya. More recently, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir disclosed in June 2024 that consultations would be held in South Sudan in July 2024, urging expedition of the confederation's founding. However, a November 2024 press release indicated these consultations had been delayed.

On a more positive note, Rwanda and Tanzania have set dates for constitutional consultations, suggesting commitment to the process continues in at least some member states. Leaders like Uganda's Yoweri Museveni have also restated their desire for the culmination of the East African Federation, reinforcing the stance that it could provide political and economic benefits for the region.

## Key Obstacles to Federation

Several significant challenges stand in the way of achieving ratification by three countries before 2030:

### Political Tensions and Regional Conflicts

The relationship between DRC and Rwanda remains particularly strained. The DRC recalled its ambassador to Kenya in December 2023 due to disagreements over Rwanda's alleged involvement with the M23 rebel group operating in eastern DRC. These diplomatic frictions make political integration extraordinarily difficult.

### Integration Challenges and Uneven Participation

The DRC, which officially became an EAC member in July 2022, has faced integration difficulties. It has reportedly failed to remit any money (owing US$14.7 million) and has yet to align its legal instruments with the EAC as required by treaty. EAC insiders have stated that "the DRC rarely takes part in meetings". This pattern suggests challenges in translating membership into meaningful integration.

### Sovereignty Concerns

Perhaps the most fundamental obstacle is the persistent fear among partner states about losing power and independence in decision-making. Countries are "still grappling with the idea of ceding sovereignty," which is necessary for a federation to function. This reluctance to surrender national authority has consistently slowed progress toward federation.

### Historical Pattern of Missed Deadlines

The federation has consistently missed its own deadlines. When the concept was first revived, a complete political union was hoped for by 2015, and a currency union by 2012, but neither materialized. This pattern of delays suggests caution when evaluating near-term prospects for ratification.

## Positive Indicators

Despite these challenges, several factors support the possibility of ratification:

### Economic Benefits

The economic case for integration remains compelling. The entire EAC region has demonstrated strong economic growth potential, with the bloc previously predicted to average 5-8% growth. A unified EAF with a shared currency, economy, and foreign policy could emerge as a major power in the long term.

### Active Constitutional Process

Despite delays, the constitutional drafting process remains active, with consultations occurring or planned in multiple member states. The continued engagement in the process demonstrates that the federation goal has not been abandoned.

### Political Champions

There are still strong advocates for federation among regional leaders. Uganda's Museveni has been a consistent proponent, and South Sudan's Kiir has urged expediting the process. This high-level political support keeps the federation vision alive.

## Most Likely Scenario

The most plausible path to achieving ratification by three countries would involve a subset of the most committed EAC members - likely Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda or Tanzania - overcoming sovereignty concerns and accelerating their constitutional processes.

These countries might be motivated by:
- The economic advantages of deeper integration in a challenging global economy
- Regional security considerations, particularly given persistent conflicts in eastern DRC
- The opportunity to establish a stronger collective voice in international affairs

However, this would require:
1. Successful completion of constitutional consultations currently underway
2. Overcoming deeply entrenched sovereignty concerns
3. Navigating complex regional politics, particularly tensions involving Rwanda
4. Significant acceleration of a process that has historically moved very slowly

## Conclusion

The East African Federation remains an ambitious vision with both significant promise and substantial obstacles. While there is continued commitment to the process, the historical pattern of delays, current political tensions, and fundamental sovereignty concerns all suggest that ratification by three countries before 2030 faces considerable challenges.

The 4.5-year timeline until 2030 does provide a window for progress, particularly if a smaller core of committed countries decides to move forward while others remain at earlier stages of integration. However, this would require overcoming persistent obstacles that have hampered the federation process for decades.
