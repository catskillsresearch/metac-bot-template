The following rationale integrates the most compelling insights from each individual forecast, synthesizing their perspectives into a cohesive argument about whether NOAA will report May 2025 as the hottest May on record.

Global temperature trends in recent years have displayed remarkable consistency in setting or challenging record highs. Every year since 2015 has ranked among the top ten warmest on record, with 2024 breaking the all-time global temperature record and early 2025 continuing this trend. NOAA’s Climate at a Glance rankings through April 2025 repeatedly mark rolling multi-month periods as "1st Warmest," clearly indicating that background warmth remains at or near unprecedented levels. April 2025 itself was the second warmest April globally, just a fraction below the all-time record set in 2024, suggesting the climate system entered May already at near-record temperatures.

During May 2025, numerous regions worldwide reported extreme heat events. Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) experienced its hottest month ever, with May temperatures 4.3°C above normal. Spain saw temperatures exceeding 41°C, while France and Scotland set new records for May. The United States also reported widespread above-normal temperatures. These regional anomalies are consistent and widespread, reinforcing the likelihood that the global average was significantly elevated for the month. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center and the World Meteorological Organization both projected "above to much-above normal" temperatures for this period, further supporting this assessment.

Several key factors contributed to this status quo of persistent warmth. The recent strong El Niño, now transitioning to a weak La Niña, has left residual heat in the climate system that is expected to dominate through mid-2025. Anthropogenic warming trends continue to push global averages upward. Measurement methodologies have remained constant, ensuring data continuity and reliability.

Potential scenarios that could have prevented May 2025 from setting a new record would require either a major, globally distributed cooling event (such as a sudden volcanic eruption or rapid oceanic cooling), or a more pronounced and rapid onset of La Niña conditions than currently forecast. Neither scenario has substantial evidence as of early June 2025. Late data revisions or isolated regional cool anomalies could theoretically offset global averages, but reports of such cool events have been absent or negligible compared to the overwhelming prevalence of heat records.

In summary, the weight of evidence—including the persistence of record-breaking global warmth since 2015, the continuation of extreme temperatures into early 2025, widespread regional heat records in May, and the absence of significant cooling anomalies or measurement changes—strongly suggests that NOAA will report May 2025 as the hottest May on record at the global scale. While minor uncertainties remain, such as last-minute data adjustments or unexpected regional cool anomalies, these are considered low-probability events given current observations and forecasts.
