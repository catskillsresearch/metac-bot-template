A contraction in U.S. GDP of -0.3% in Q1 2025 set a challenging national context for state-level growth, driven largely by a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariffs, which particularly affected states with high trade exposure. All three states—Texas, New York, and Virginia—therefore faced significant headwinds, but their prospects diverged based on structural economic characteristics and sectoral vulnerabilities.

Texas, historically a national leader in population and job growth, entered Q1 2025 with a diversified economy and continued strength in attracting talent and business investment. However, its outperformance was challenged by explicit tariff-related uncertainty, given Texas’s status as an export-heavy state with substantial manufacturing and energy sectors. This made Texas more susceptible to trade shocks and contributed to a deteriorating outlook. Despite these pressures, its economic resilience, large and expanding population, and broad-based industrial base provided some insulation and, in the absence of severe state-specific disruptions, still positioned it as the most likely leader in Q1 2025 real GDP growth among the three states.

New York State, with its large, diversified economy and the nation’s most prominent financial sector, was less exposed to goods trade volatility than Texas. While New York’s growth dynamics lagged pre-pandemic expectations—evident in continued population stagnation and repeated placement among the nation’s slowest economies—its service-oriented composition, especially financial services, may have provided some relative strength during a quarter where goods-producing states were hit hardest. Nonetheless, the state’s overall momentum remained subdued, and its prospects for outperforming Texas depended on a stronger-than-expected rebound or a lower-than-expected impact from trade disruptions.

Virginia faced the most negative assessments heading into Q1 2025. Federal Reserve and regional data signaled a “lagging” economic forecast and even “shrinking GDP,” factors compounded by historic weaknesses in sectors tied to federal spending. Even positive signals, such as projected franchise business growth and a budget surplus, were not enough to offset these broad declines, making it the least likely to lead among the three. However, an unexpected surge in its franchise sector or a reversal in federal contracting trends could have improved its relative standing, albeit as a lower-probability scenario.

Given the national downturn and marginal or even negative growth rates across all three states, the difference in Q1 2025 could be slight. As BEA reporting conventions round growth to one decimal place, a statistical tie is a plausible outcome. In summary, Texas retained the advantage due to its enduring economic dynamism, but its margin narrowed in the face of acute trade challenges; New York’s services strength offered some cushion, and Virginia was hampered by broader contraction, but all were susceptible to surprises in a turbulent quarter.
