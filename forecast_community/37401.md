## Rationale: Will Donald Trump Grant Executive Clemency to More Than 2 Individuals in June 2025?

Donald Trump’s second presidency has been marked by an exceptionally high volume and frequency of executive clemency grants. Since January 2025, he has granted clemency to more than 1,500 individuals—dramatically outpacing historical norms and even his own first-term record. This period has included not just isolated pardons but substantial clusters of commutations and pardons delivered in quick succession, often encompassing high-profile political allies, celebrities, and other notable figures.

In late May 2025, official records and news reports document a "flurry" or "spree" of pardons: over two dozen clemency actions were taken on May 28 and May 29 alone. The momentum and scale of these recent actions suggest that frequent, batch-style clemency is now the established pattern. Importantly, there is no public indication or official statement from the White House or Department of Justice suggesting a pause or policy shift away from this approach as June begins.

Trump and his administration have also signaled that more clemencies are likely, with Trump himself telling reporters that additional clemency actions could be forthcoming—sometimes even referencing specific pending cases or categories of potential recipients. The recent appointment of Ed Martin as the pardon attorney has streamlined the clemency process, suggesting administrative capacity for continued high-volume actions.

While there are theoretically plausible scenarios—such as significant political backlash, shifting priorities due to unfolding domestic or international events, or a sudden change in legal strategy—that could temporarily slow or halt the pace of clemency, these have not materialized as of late May 2025. Trump’s historical behavior indicates a willingness to use his clemency power assertively, often in the face of controversy or criticism.

The default expectation, grounded in the clear and ongoing trend, is that Trump will continue to grant executive clemency to more than two individuals in June 2025. The only credible path to a different outcome would involve unforeseen, compelling new constraints or an abrupt strategic decision—neither of which is evidenced in current reporting or the observed trajectory of Trump's actions.

In summary, the combined weight of established precedent, recent events, administrative signaling, and the absence of factors indicating imminent restraint point to a strong likelihood that Trump will grant executive clemency to more than two individuals in June 2025.
