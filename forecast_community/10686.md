## Rationale for the Likelihood of Obergefell v. Hodges Being Overturned Before 2030

Obergefell v. Hodges, decided in 2015 by a narrow 5–4 margin, established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage nationwide. Over the past decade, this decision has become deeply integrated into American society, with approximately 775,000 same-sex marriages having occurred since the ruling. Public support for same-sex marriage is both strong and stable, holding at 68% nationally as of 2025, with a record-high but increasingly partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans.

Despite this broad acceptance, several recent developments have increased scrutiny on Obergefell’s future. The U.S. Supreme Court has shifted further to the right since 2015 and demonstrated its willingness to overturn major precedents, most notably in its 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which reversed Roe v. Wade. In his Dobbs concurrence, Justice Clarence Thomas explicitly called for the reconsideration of substantive due process precedents, specifically naming Obergefell among them. This signal, alongside vocal opposition from some conservative lawmakers—such as the introduction of resolutions in Michigan and other states urging the Court to revisit Obergefell—reflects an environment in which legal and political pressure to reexamine the decision is growing.

However, significant obstacles remain that make an overturn before 2030 unlikely:

- **Legal Pathway**: As of mid-2025, there is no direct challenge to Obergefell rapidly advancing through the federal courts or on the Supreme Court’s docket. For reversal to occur, a state would need to pass and defend a law contravening Obergefell, withstand lower court defeats, and persuade the Supreme Court to grant review—a process typically requiring several years.
- **Judicial Caution**: While some justices have expressed openness to reconsidering Obergefell, the majority of the Court has not signaled imminent intent to do so. Justice Thomas’s call to revisit these precedents was not joined by other justices and does not bind future decisions.
- **Social and Practical Considerations**: Overturning Obergefell would disrupt hundreds of thousands of existing marriages and provoke considerable political backlash, as warned by analysts and reflected in the public response to the Dobbs decision. The Court may be hesitant to trigger widespread social disruption, particularly given the strong public reliance interests and the recent experience with the fallout from reversing long-standing constitutional rights.
- **Federal Legislative Backstop**: The Respect for Marriage Act, signed into law in 2022, ensures that even if Obergefell is overturned, same-sex marriages performed in any state must retain federal recognition. While not preventing states from enacting bans if the Supreme Court allows, this law reduces the immediate consequences of a reversal and may lower the Court’s urgency to revisit the constitutional question.
- **Case Law Momentum**: Advocacy organizations emphasize that, as of now, “no serious momentum in the case law is currently building to reverse this decision”. Most legal actions and resolutions introduced to date have not advanced beyond symbolic gestures or early legislative stages.

In summary, although the risk of Obergefell being overturned is higher than it was several years ago—due to an emboldened conservative legal movement, explicit calls for reconsideration by some justices, and increased state-level activism—multiple institutional, legal, and societal barriers continue to make reversal before 2030 a difficult and unlikely outcome. Broad public support, federal safeguards, significant reliance interests, and the absence of a current Supreme Court case challenging the precedent all reinforce the enduring status quo.
