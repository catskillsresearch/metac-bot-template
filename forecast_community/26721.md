(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  
About 7.5 months remain until the S&P 500 closing value on December 31, 2025, determines the outcome.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of early May 2025, the S&P 500 is down approximately 4–8% from its record highs and its 2024 close[2][5]. If these prices persist through year-end, the answer would be "No" — the index would end 2025 below its 2024 close.

(c) **Scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
If tariffs remain in effect, investor caution persists, or a significant macroeconomic or geopolitical shock occurs, the S&P 500 could finish 2025 lower than the 2024 close. For example, continued fear about inflation, trade wars, or a U.S. recession could drive further equity outflows and risk aversion — maintaining or deepening the current negative year-to-date performance[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A positive resolution could unfold if U.S. economic data surprises to the upside, tariffs are rolled back, or geopolitical tensions ease. Renewed optimism in corporate earnings, strong consumer spending, and continued advances in key sectors like artificial intelligence could reverse 2025's early losses and drive the S&P 500 above its 2024 close by year-end[1][4].

## Rationale

Recent history and long-term trends favor gradual positive movement in the S&P 500, especially given the index's average annual return of 8.3% since 1998[1]. However, the current situation is different: after two years of extraordinary gains (over 25% per year in 2023 and 2024), the market started 2025 at stretched valuations, leaving little margin for disappointment[2][3]. 

Midway through 2025, caution has overtaken bullishness — major Wall Street banks have cut targets, citing the impact of broad tariffs introduced by the Trump administration, which weighed on sentiment and triggered a significant correction (with the S&P 500 down 4–8% year-to-date as of early May)[2][5]. Risks relating to inflation, geopolitics, and policy uncertainty remain elevated[3][5]. 

Nonetheless, consensus among major banks at the start of the year was moderately bullish, with end-2025 targets typically 8–10% above 2024 closes[1][4]. Goldman Sachs, for instance, still projects a 9% price gain, assuming resilient corporate earnings and solid GDP growth[1]. There is a plausible path to a market rebound if economic conditions hold or improve, especially considering the index's tendency to recover after corrections.

Good forecasters lean toward the status quo, and given a historically upward bias in the index and the tendency for corrections to be followed by recoveries, I put extra weight on the possibility of a rebound, though the probability is lower than in a typical year due to elevated risks and the weak start to 2025. Both upside and downside risks are pronounced, with political and policy volatility as potential swing factors.
