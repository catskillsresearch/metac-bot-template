# Cost Analysis for Whole Brain Emulation Runtime

The cost of running a whole brain emulation (WBE) for one subjective hour will depend on several critical factors, with the outcome contingent on technological developments, required simulation fidelity, and the timeline of achievement.

## Computational Requirements and Hardware Costs

The computational demands for whole brain emulation vary dramatically based on the level of detail required:

- **Low-fidelity approaches** (neural network approximations): 10^16-10^18 operations per second
- **Medium-fidelity approaches** (detailed neuron and synapse models): 10^18-10^20 operations per second
- **High-fidelity approaches** (molecular-level simulation): 10^22-10^25 operations per second

Current estimates suggest that real-time simulation of a human brain at moderate fidelity would require approximately 1,000 H100 GPUs, costing roughly $30 million in hardware alone. Using these high-end GPUs as a baseline, a system would cost $30,000-$40,000 per GPU, not including broader system integration, facility, and operating costs.

Hardware costs for brain-equivalent computing power have historically decreased by approximately 50% every 1.6 years. If this trend continues, the cost per computation will continue to drop significantly by the time WBE is achieved.

## Current Research Benchmarks

The BRAIN 2025 initiative estimated that mapping and modeling the whole brain would cost over $100 million and require substantial person-years of effort. For perspective, mapping just a 1 mm cube of cortex (approximately 0.2% of the whole brain) would take 10,000 person-years and cost more than $100 million.

A key reference point comes from a 2013 experiment where the K supercomputer simulated just 1% of the human brain for 1 second, taking 40 minutes to complete and consuming approximately $400 worth of electricity per hour. This suggests full brain simulation would require significantly more resources.

## Scanning and Data Acquisition Costs

Besides computational requirements, scanning and data acquisition represent major costs and bottlenecks:

- Modern electron microscopes cost approximately $1 million each
- Scanning the mouse connectome (which is 500 times smaller than what has been fully imaged) is projected to cost about $10 billion and take 15 years
- The human brain, being vastly more complex, would require proportionally more resources
- It cost approximately $100 million to scan just 1 mmÂ³ of mouse cortex in the MiCRONS program

## Timeline Considerations

The timeline for achieving WBE remains uncertain. Many experts believe it may take at least 60 years to emulate a human brain. However, others suggest that lo-fi approaches based on distilling behavioral and neural data could be achieved sooner and at much lower costs.

Dr. Sandberg, a prominent researcher in the field, assigns only about a 5% probability of achieving brain emulation within 10 years, though he believes emulating simpler organisms like fruit flies within that timeframe is quite feasible.

## Factors Affecting Final Cost

Several key factors will determine the ultimate cost per subjective hour:

1. **Required simulation detail**: The level of biological detail needed for functional equivalence could affect costs by orders of magnitude.

2. **Hardware specialization**: Neuromorphic computing or specialized hardware designed specifically for neural simulation could dramatically reduce costs compared to general-purpose computing.

3. **Timeline of achievement**: The longer WBE takes to achieve, the lower the hardware costs are likely to be when it finally occurs due to continued technological advances.

4. **Scaling and optimization**: Initial costs will likely drop rapidly after the first successful demonstration as optimization occurs.

Based on all available evidence and technological trends, the cost per hour of subjective runtime for the first whole brain emulation (in 2019 USD) will likely fall in the range of $1,000 to $100,000, with significant probability mass both above and below this range depending on the factors outlined above.
