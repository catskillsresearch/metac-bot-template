(a) Time left until outcome: Less than 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: None of the Millennium Prize Problems have been solved by AI systems as of today.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: AI systems continue to make incremental progress in mathematical reasoning but fail to achieve the breakthrough capabilities needed to solve problems that have stumped the world's best mathematicians for decades. The remaining time is too short for the necessary advancements, verification, and peer review process.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: A company like Harmonic, which has been specifically targeting mathematical superintelligence, announces a breakthrough solution to one of the "easier" Millennium Prize Problems in the coming weeks. The solution is quickly verified by the mathematical community and published in reputable journals.

As a professional forecaster, I need to provide a calibrated assessment of whether an AI system will solve one of the remaining Millennium Prize Problems before July 1, 2025. With less than 7 weeks remaining until the deadline, I'll analyze the available information and provide my forecast.

## Current Status of AI and Millennium Prize Problems

The Millennium Prize Problems represent some of the most challenging unsolved problems in mathematics. As of today, May 12, 2025, none of the remaining six problems has been solved by an AI system[1][3]. The only problem solved so far was the Poincar√© Conjecture, which was solved by mathematician Grigori Perelman in 2003, not by an AI system[3].

Several prediction markets and forecasting platforms have addressed this question:
- Metaculus has an open question about whether an AI will solve a Millennium Prize Problem before July 2025[1]
- Manifold Markets has a similar question with a deadline of June 2025[3]

According to Manifold Markets, forecasters have placed this probability at a very low level - around 5%[3]. This reflects the general consensus that while AI has made progress in mathematical reasoning, solving a Millennium Prize Problem represents a significant leap beyond current capabilities.

## Recent AI Developments in Mathematics

There are some signs of progress in AI mathematical reasoning:

- Harmonic, a company founded in 2023 by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Tudor Achim, is specifically focused on building Mathematical Superintelligence (MSI)[4]
- Harmonic has developed a system that achieves 90% on MiniF2F, a formal mathematics benchmark[4]
- The company has secured $75 million in funding to accelerate its development of AI with superior mathematical capabilities[4]

However, achieving 90% on a benchmark is still far from solving problems that have resisted solution by the world's top mathematicians for decades. The search results do not indicate that any AI system has made significant progress toward solving any of the specific Millennium Prize Problems.

## Time Constraints and Verification Requirements

With less than 7 weeks remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, there are significant time constraints:

1. An AI would need to produce a solution immediately
2. The solution would need to be verified by experts
3. At least two reputable papers would need to be published showing the solution is correct[3]
4. The mathematical community would need to reach consensus on the validity of the solution

The typical timeline for peer review and consensus-building in mathematics for groundbreaking results often takes months or years, not weeks.

## Weighing the Status Quo

As a forecaster, I recognize the importance of anchoring on the status quo. Mathematical breakthroughs of this magnitude are rare events, and the problems have remained unsolved despite decades of effort by brilliant human mathematicians.

While AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, there is no concrete evidence from the search results that any AI system is on the verge of solving a Millennium Prize Problem. The Manifold Markets estimate of around 5% probability seems reasonable given the information available[3].

In fact, according to a conversation referenced in the search results, even optimistic AI researchers seem to be forecasting AI-human collaborations solving a Millennium Prize Problem around 2028, not before July 2025[5].

## Final Assessment

Considering:
- The extremely challenging nature of the remaining problems
- The lack of reported significant progress by AI on any specific Millennium Prize Problem
- The short timeframe remaining before the deadline
- The verification requirements that would need to be satisfied
- The status quo bias that appropriately applies to rare breakthrough events

Probability: 3%
