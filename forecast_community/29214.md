Based on the available information, I'll address this forecasting question with a structured approach:

(a) Time left until outcome is known: 3 months and 4 days (from May 12, 2025, until the August 15, 2025 TSE registration deadline)

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Lula is the incumbent president but has not officially registered as a candidate for the 2026 election.

(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome: Lula, who will be 80 in 2026, decides his age is too advanced for another term and endorses a successor from within the PT, potentially finance minister Fernando Haddad or former Bahia governor Rui Costa, despite their lower popularity. Health concerns could also prompt his withdrawal, or he might respond to the 58% of voters who don't want him to run again.

(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome: Lacking a viable successor with comparable popularity, and facing pressure from his party, Lula decides to run again to prevent the right from regaining power. His 52% potential voter support (the highest among tested candidates) convinces him that he remains the left's best chance for electoral victory.

I'll now provide my rationale and probability assessment:

The question of whether Lula will be a candidate for president of Brazil in 2026 requires careful examination of the evidence. As a professional forecaster, I'll analyze the current political landscape, historical precedents, and key indicators.

## Current Political Context

The Brazilian political landscape shows Lula as the dominant figure on the left with no clear successor in sight. According to recent polling data, Lula has emerged as the political figure with the highest potential for voter support among ten names tested, with 52% saying they know and would vote for him[4]. This strong position gives him a significant advantage over potential rivals.

However, there are concerning signs for Lula's candidacy. His disapproval rating reached 53% in March 2025, with 44% of voters believing his administration is worse than Bolsonaro's[5]. Nearly 60% of voters say they do not trust him, and there's widespread dissatisfaction with the government's performance in all areas of federal administration[5].

## Succession Planning Challenges

The Workers' Party (PT) faces a significant succession planning problem. By 2026, Lula will be 80 years old, and while he has previously stated he would not run for the presidency again, the lack of viable alternatives puts pressure on him to reconsider[3]. 

Fernando Haddad, currently serving as Lula's finance minister, lacks the necessary popular appeal despite his economic achievements[3]. Other potential candidates like Gleisi Hoffmann (PT president) and Rui Costa (former governor of Bahia) also pale in comparison to Lula's popularity[3]. This leadership vacuum creates strong internal pressure for Lula to run again.

## Opposition Landscape

The right-wing opposition to Lula is currently weakened. Former President Jair Bolsonaro, who would be Lula's main competitor, is facing legal challenges. In March 2025, the Supreme Court unanimously accepted Bolsonaro's indictment for conspiring to commit a coup to reverse the 2022 election results[3]. He is currently ineligible to run until 2030[4].

Bolsonaro's removal from the electoral landscape significantly changes the calculus for Lula. Without his main rival, Lula might feel less pressure to run personally, potentially opening the door for succession. Alternatively, he might see it as an opportunity to secure another term with reduced opposition.

## Historical Precedents and Age Considerations

At 80 years old in 2026, Lula would be among the oldest presidential candidates globally. While advanced age is not disqualifying (as demonstrated by other world leaders), it does raise questions about stamina for a full term and potential health concerns. This factor cannot be dismissed in Lula's personal calculations.

## Weighing Status Quo and Institutional Factors

The status quo in Brazilian politics tends toward incumbent advantage. Brazilian presidents typically seek reelection when constitutionally permitted, and parties rarely voluntarily surrender incumbent advantage. The PT's institutional interest strongly favors Lula's candidacy given the lack of alternatives.

However, public opinion shows complexity - a majority (58%) believes Lula should not run for reelection, while 40% support another candidacy. This split opinion could factor into his decision-making process.

## Final Assessment

Weighing these factors, I find that the strongest evidence points toward Lula becoming a candidate in 2026:

1. The PT lacks a viable successor with comparable popularity
2. Bolsonaro's legal troubles weaken the opposition
3. Lula maintains the highest potential voter support among tested candidates
4. Historical precedent favors incumbent candidacy

The main factors that could prevent his candidacy are his advanced age and potentially declining popularity. However, given the Brazilian left's continued reliance on his leadership and the absence of a clear alternative, these concerns are likely to be outweighed by political necessity.

Applying appropriate weight to the status quo and institutional factors, while acknowledging the uncertainty introduced by Lula's age and declining approval ratings, I arrive at my final assessment.

Probability: 70%
