(a) Time until outcome: Approximately 6 weeks (from May 14, 2025 to June 28, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Based on historical patterns, 1-2 new artists typically enter the Billboard Artist 100 top 10 in any given week
(c) Unexpected outcome scenario: Multiple major album releases coinciding with the week of June 28, 2025, or a viral social media trend propelling several previously lower-ranked artists simultaneously into the top 10

Looking at the Billboard Artist 100 chart dynamics, I need to assess how many artists in the top 10 for the week of June 28, 2025, will be new to the top 10 that specific week.

## Current Billboard Chart Landscape

The Billboard Artist 100 measures artist popularity across all consumption metrics, including album and track sales, radio airplay, and streaming. Based on the search results, we can observe that the Billboard charts generally demonstrate stability, especially in the top positions.

From recent Billboard Hot 100 data, we can see that Kendrick Lamar and SZA's collaboration "Luther" has maintained the #1 position for 12 consecutive weeks as of mid-May 2025[3]. This suggests strong chart stability for established artists. The current Hot 100 top 10 also includes other prominent artists like Morgan Wallen, Alex Warren, Chappell Roan, Drake, and Shaboozey[3].

## Historical Turnover Rate Analysis

While the search results don't provide explicit data on Artist 100 turnover rates, we can infer patterns from related Billboard charts:

1. Most artists tend to remain in the top positions for multiple weeks, with gradual movement rather than dramatic shifts
2. New entries to the top 10 typically coincide with major album or single releases
3. Based on historical patterns across Billboard charts, 1-2 new artists entering the top 10 in any given week appears to be the norm

## June 2025 Music Release Calendar

Looking at upcoming releases that might impact the late June charts:

- 10cm is scheduled to release their 5th regular album in July 2025, which might generate pre-release momentum in late June[3]
- Olivia Rodrigo has a headline show at London's BST Hyde Park on June 27, 2025, which could boost her chart position around that time[3]
- Several artists have scheduled performances in late June, including Rahma Riad and Hussain Al Jassmi (June 28)[3], which might increase their visibility

## Factors That Could Increase Turnover

Several factors could lead to higher turnover in the Artist 100 top 10:

1. **Album Release Cycles**: Major artists releasing new albums in mid-June would see chart impact by the June 28 chart
2. **Surprise Releases**: Unannounced albums from major artists (a strategy increasingly common in the industry)
3. **Viral Success**: Social media-driven breakthrough hits (like we've seen with Alex Warren's "Ordinary" reaching #2 on the Hot 100)[3]
4. **Seasonal Factors**: Late June marks the beginning of summer, which historically sees new "song of the summer" contenders emerging

## Factors Supporting Chart Stability

Conversely, several factors suggest limited turnover:

1. **Established Artist Dominance**: Artists like Kendrick Lamar, SZA, and Drake have demonstrated remarkable chart longevity
2. **Streaming Persistence**: Streaming numbers tend to sustain popular artists in chart positions longer than in the pre-streaming era
3. **Limited Major Releases**: No major album announcements for mid-June are evident in the search results

## Final Assessment

Given the chart patterns observed in early-mid 2025, the historical stability of Billboard charts, and the known music release calendar, I expect moderate turnover in the Artist 100 top 10 for the week of June 28.

The most likely outcome is that one or two artists will be new to the top 10 that week. This aligns with typical chart dynamics where most artists maintain their positions with gradual movement.

However, I must account for the possibility of surprise releases or viral breakouts, which could push three new artists into the top 10. The probability of four or more new artists entering simultaneously is lower but not impossible, particularly if multiple major releases coincide.

Zero new artists is also possible but less likely given natural chart movement and the summer season timing.

Zero: 15%
One or Two: 60%
Three: 20%
Four or more: 5%
