With about 25 years remaining until the outcome is determined, current trends indicate that the many‐worlds interpretation is endorsed by only a small minority of physicists—often observed in single-digit to low double‐digit percentages in recent surveys. In the absence of significant change, it is reasonable to expect that traditional frameworks such as the Copenhagen interpretation, or a pragmatic “shut up and calculate” attitude, will continue to dominate the discourse in physics. This inertia, combined with the historically slow evolution of fundamental views in the field, suggests that without a transformative shift, future polling is likely to continue reflecting that limited support.

On the other hand, it is also conceivable that a series of groundbreaking theoretical advances or decisive experimental breakthroughs—possibly driven by developments in quantum information science or other emerging areas—could radically alter the current landscape. Should such a paradigm‐shifting development occur, it might prompt a rapid reassessment within the physics community, leading to a sizable shift in attitudes toward the many‐worlds interpretation.

Thus, the future consensus among physicists hinges on whether or not compelling new evidence and persuasive arguments emerge over the coming decades. Under the status quo, the many‐worlds view is expected to remain in the minority, but an unexpected breakthrough could potentially tip the balance to a majority acceptance by 2050.
