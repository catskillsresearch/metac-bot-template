(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 4 months (from May 12, 2025 until the September 2025 parliamentary elections)

(b) Status quo outcome: No official referendum on EU membership has been announced by the Norwegian government.

(c) Scenario for No outcome: The current political leadership maintains its position of ruling out a renewed EU debate despite increased public interest. Coalition politics and the upcoming election cause parties to avoid potentially divisive issues, focusing instead on immediate economic concerns and the fallout from the January 2025 government collapse over EU energy rules.

(d) Scenario for Yes outcome: Increasing trade tensions with the US and growing public support for EU membership (now at 41%) create urgent political pressure. The Conservative opposition led by Erna Solberg successfully leverages the issue ahead of September elections, forcing the current government to announce a referendum to prevent losing electoral support on the issue.

Based on the available information, I need to assess the probability of Norway announcing an official referendum on EU accession before September 2025.

## Current Political Landscape

The Norwegian political environment regarding EU membership shows increased interest but remains divided. Support for EU membership has risen considerably in recent months, reaching 41% in early 2025, up from 27% in 2023[1]. However, the "no" side still leads with 48% of public opinion[1]. 

Importantly, 63% of Norwegians are positive toward holding a new referendum on EU membership, showing appetite for revisiting the question regardless of personal stance on membership[1]. This represents significant public interest in at least having the debate.

## Political Constraints

Despite growing public interest, the Norwegian political leadership has explicitly "ruled out a renewed EU debate" as of April 2025[1]. This strong stance from the current government is a significant barrier to any near-term referendum announcement.

The collapse of Norway's government in January 2025 over the adoption of EU energy rules demonstrates the politically volatile nature of EU-related decisions[1]. With parliamentary elections approaching in September 2025, parties may be hesitant to stake positions on divisive issues like EU membership.

## External Pressures

Several factors are increasing pressure on Norway to reconsider its EU stance:

1. US trade tariffs imposed by President Trump have created economic concerns[5]
2. Norway is struggling to prevent getting caught in the crossfire of EU-US tariffs[1]
3. The realization that "even the closest possible partnership with the EU is not the same as membership"[1]
4. Iceland's commitment to hold an EU membership referendum by 2027 is influencing the Norwegian debate[5]

## Historical Resistance and Status Quo Bias

Norway has rejected EU membership twice in referendums (1972 and 1994)[2][5]. This historical resistance creates institutional inertia against change. Additionally, the current government explicitly ruling out a renewed EU debate represents a strong status quo position that would require significant political capital to overturn.

## Timing Considerations

With just four months remaining until the September 2025 elections, there is limited time for the political calculus to change dramatically. Major policy reversals typically require more runway, especially on issues that have been explicitly ruled out by the current leadership.

The Conservative opposition led by Erna Solberg supports EU membership and could potentially win the September elections[5], but this would be too late to impact the outcome of this forecast question.

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly suggests that the status quo will prevail in the short term. While public opinion is shifting and external pressures mounting, the explicit stance of the current government against reopening the EU debate, combined with the approaching elections and historical resistance to EU membership, make an announcement before September 2025 unlikely.

A referendum announcement would require a dramatic reversal of the government's stated position within a compressed timeframe. While not impossible given the volatile international trade environment and rising public interest, it remains improbable based on current information.

Probability: 15%
