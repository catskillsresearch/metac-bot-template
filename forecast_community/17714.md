# Norway's EU Referendum: Analysis of Potential Announcement Before September 2025

Norway's relationship with the European Union has entered a period of significant reconsideration, with growing public support for EU membership and a referendum on the issue. However, whether the government will announce an official referendum before the September 2025 parliamentary elections depends on several interconnected factors.

## Current Political Climate

The Norwegian political leadership has explicitly ruled out reopening the EU membership debate despite growing public interest. Both Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and former Prime Minister Erna Solberg have cautioned against starting a new EU debate, with Støre stating, "We should use our energy on the agreement we have with Europe, not on something else." They fear such a debate could create division when Norway faces other pressing issues.

The Center Party, which recently experienced a government collapse in January 2025 over EU energy rules, has made opposition to EU membership a key campaign issue. Party leader Trygve Slagsvold Vedum has warned that his party will only support a government budget if there is a guarantee against an EU referendum in the next parliamentary period.

## Public Opinion Trends

Support for EU membership in Norway has increased significantly:
- From 27% in 2023 to 41% in recent polls
- Opposition remains at 48%
- 63% of Norwegians now favor holding a new referendum on EU membership

This represents the highest level of support for the EU in over a decade, though still not a majority favoring membership itself.

## External Pressures and Regional Context

Several external factors are influencing Norway's EU considerations:

1. **Trade tensions**: Norway is currently concerned about being caught in the crossfire of US-EU tariffs, with over 70% of Norwegian exports going to the EU.

2. **EEA limitations**: Norway's government collapsed in January 2025 over the adoption of EU energy rules, highlighting how deeply EU policies affect Norway even without membership. As an EEA/EFTA member, Norway aligns most of its regulation, trade, and foreign policy with the EU but lacks a seat at the decision-making table.

3. **Nordic developments**: Iceland has promised to hold a referendum on EU membership by 2027. Norway is closely watching this development, which could influence its own approach to the EU question.

## Political Calculations

Despite growing support for a referendum, several factors suggest the status quo will prevail before September:

1. With only about 3-4 months until the election, launching such a divisive referendum now would be politically risky.

2. Political parties typically avoid introducing highly contentious issues immediately before elections.

3. The liberal Venstre party has promised to hold a new referendum on EU membership by 2029 if they gain influence after the election, indicating they don't expect one before then.

4. Major political figures across different parties have cautioned against a new EU debate before the election.

5. Historical precedent shows that Norway approaches EU membership questions cautiously, with two previous referendums (1972 and 1994) both rejecting membership by narrow margins.

## Scenarios for Change

A referendum announcement before September 2025 would likely require:

1. A dramatic external event such as a severe economic crisis caused by escalating trade wars between the US and EU
2. A significant security incident that creates urgent need for closer European integration
3. An unexpected shift in coalition dynamics forcing action on the issue

## Conclusion

While public opinion toward EU membership has shifted significantly and external pressures are mounting, the political leadership across major parties has strategically decided to defer the EU referendum question until after the September 2025 elections. The Norwegian government has stated that a new referendum is possible "within the next 10 years," emphasizing a long-term rather than immediate perspective.

The strong status quo bias, explicit statements from political leaders against reopening the debate before elections, and the lack of a clear pro-EU majority make a pre-election referendum announcement highly unlikely absent a major crisis or unexpected political realignment.
