## Rationale

As of mid-2025, Russia occupies substantial portions of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, excluding Crimea, amounting to roughly 19–20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory. Over the past year, the military front has largely stabilized in Russia’s favor, with occasional incremental Russian advances and virtually no significant Ukrainian territorial recapture since late 2023. The pace of territorial change is slow, but consistently leans toward further consolidation of Russian gains.

Russian policy remains firm and maximalist: the Kremlin publicly and repeatedly demands the official cession of all occupied non-Crimean oblasts as the precondition for any settlement, and neither rhetoric nor negotiation stances out of Moscow show indications of compromise or flexibility. Diplomatic efforts, including renewed peace talks, have failed to move Russia from its annexation demands, and Western proposals increasingly reference Ukrainian security guarantees rather than the restoration of all lost territory. While some international actors continue to support Ukraine, the reliability and scale of future Western military and economic aid is subject to persistent political uncertainty and could weaken over the coming years.

On the Ukrainian side, the ability to reclaim lost ground is increasingly constrained by resource limitations, chronic battlefield attrition, and the daunting scale of required operations. Successful recapture of all occupied non-Crimean territory by 2029 would demand dramatic and currently absent shifts: a substantial, sustained increase in Western military aid, decisive battlefield breakthroughs, or a sudden collapse of Russian political resolve or military logistics. None of these transformative developments appear imminent or supported by existing indicators.

Historically, entrenched conflicts with high strategic stakes and hardened fronts tend to favor the continuation of the status quo unless disrupted by dramatic systemic shocks. In this context, the probability of Ukraine regaining all non-Crimean territory by 2029 is low, while the risk of further losses—should Russian forces exploit Ukrainian vulnerabilities or Western support falter—remains present. Russian occupation of parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia is likely to persist through at least early 2029, barring unforeseen, radical shifts in military balance or political dynamics. Absent such disruptions, the persistence of Russian occupation and the lack of successful Ukrainian counteroffensives make the outcome of Ukraine losing non-Crimean territory by February 2029 highly probable.
