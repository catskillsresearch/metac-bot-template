# Syrian Refugee Numbers in Jordan: July 1, 2025 Forecast Rationale

The number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan by July 1, 2025, requires careful analysis of recent trends, expert expectations, and potential scenarios that could influence refugee movements in the coming weeks.

## Current Situation and Recent Trends

As of April 30, 2025, UNHCR reports 546,298 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. This represents the most recent official count and serves as our baseline. Since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, there has been a notable increase in voluntary returns to Syria. Approximately 55,732 Syrian refugees have returned from Jordan to Syria between December 2024 and the end of April 2025, representing about 9-10% of the refugee population that was present before these returns began.

The return rate has fluctuated significantly month by month. February 2025 saw approximately 18,000 returns, which decreased to around 6,500 in March 2025. This reduction coincided with Ramadan and indicates that many refugees are timing their returns strategically, with many waiting until after the school year ends in summer 2025.

## Factors Affecting Returns

Several key factors will influence the number of Syrian refugees remaining in Jordan by July 1:

**Seasonal Patterns**: The approaching summer coincides with the end of the academic year, which many refugee families have been waiting for before returning to Syria. This timing aligns directly with our forecast period and suggests an acceleration in returns during June 2025.

**Post-Assad Dynamics**: The political transition following the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024 has created new possibilities for returns, though uncertainty remains. UNHCR has noted that while many refugees express hope about returning, most remain cautious.

**Refugee Intentions**: A regional survey conducted in January 2025 showed that 40% of Syrian refugees in Jordan expressed a desire to return within the next 12 months, while 60% have not made up their minds or do not intend to return in 2025. The primary concerns cited include safety, security, housing availability, and access to basic services in Syria.

**Economic Conditions**: About 67% of Syrian refugees in Jordan fall below the poverty line, with 9 out of 10 resorting to debt to cover basic needs such as rent, food, and medicine. These difficult conditions in Jordan may push more refugees to consider returning, despite uncertainties in Syria.

## Short-term Projection

With only 41 days remaining until July 1, we can project the most likely outcomes based on current trends:

If returns continue at the recent average rate of approximately 10,000-15,000 per month through May and June, we would expect a reduction of 20,000-30,000 refugees from the April 30 figure. This suggests a likely range of 516,000-526,000 registered Syrian refugees by July 1.

However, considering the expected increase in returns during summer once schools close, the actual number could trend toward the lower end of this range.

## Potential Scenarios

**Accelerated Returns Scenario**: A substantial improvement in Syria's security situation, combined with increased international funding for reconstruction and reintegration efforts, could significantly accelerate return rates. If neighboring countries establish successful repatriation programs that demonstrate safe conditions, this could encourage more refugees in Jordan to return quickly, potentially reducing the number to around 480,000-500,000 by July 1.

**Stable Numbers Scenario**: If the security situation in Syria deteriorates or if economic reconstruction proceeds more slowly than anticipated, many refugees currently considering return might postpone their decisions. Additionally, if Jordan receives increased international support for hosting refugees, the number might remain higher, potentially close to current levels around 540,000.

## Conclusion

Taking all factors into account, the most likely outcome points to approximately 520,000-535,000 registered Syrian refugees remaining in Jordan by July 1, 2025. This projection accounts for the anticipated summer increase in returns while recognizing that the majority of refugees still express hesitancy about returning to Syria in the immediate future.

The number will likely decrease from the current 546,298, but the relatively short timeframe until July 1 constrains how much change can realistically occur in just over a month, even with the seasonal factors at play.
