The BRICS bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, along with newly added members, faces a complex interplay of factors that could influence its cohesion over the next 9.5 years. Historically, BRICS has demonstrated resilience and stability, maintaining its membership despite geopolitical shifts and internal differences. The expansion to include new members suggests a commitment to strengthening the bloc, enhancing its economic and geopolitical influence. This expansion could provide substantial benefits, encouraging members to remain part of the group.

However, the inclusion of diverse political and economic systems introduces new dynamics that could lead to internal conflicts. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between China and Western-leaning members like India and Brazil, could escalate, leading to significant policy disagreements. Additionally, countries with historical policy volatility, such as Argentina, might experience political shifts that prioritize alignment with Western nations, potentially prompting a withdrawal from BRICS.

The 12-year timeframe until 2035 allows for potential geopolitical shifts and multiple election cycles, increasing the likelihood of changes in membership. While the inertia of international organizations and the benefits of membership may outweigh the challenges, historical precedents from other international organizations show that exits, though infrequent, do occur. The probability of a member leaving BRICS is moderate, given the potential for irreconcilable differences and the complex interplay of geopolitical interests. Nonetheless, the default assumption remains stability, unless significant changes occur.
