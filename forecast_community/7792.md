(a) **Time until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until January 1, 2026.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
No exchange of weapon fire between Taiwan (Republic of China) and the People’s Republic of China has caused at least 100 deaths as of May 13, 2025. If the situation continues unchanged (i.e., military exercises and close encounters but no direct, fatal clashes), the outcome will be **No**.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome:**  
Despite continued escalatory rhetoric, frequent incursions, and aggressive military exercises by the PLA near Taiwan, both sides remain highly disciplined and risk-averse. There are no major incidents involving direct exchanges of fire causing significant casualties. The pattern of intimidation and political signaling persists, but with no loss of life on a scale that meets the resolution criteria. Mutual restraint holds due to the severe economic, human, and political risks of escalation, reinforced by the deterrent presence of the United States and diplomatic pressure from other regional actors.

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:**  
A miscalculation or accidental military encounter, such as a fighter jet shootdown or naval skirmish, escalates rapidly, leading to an exchange of fire between PLA and ROC forces. This incident—possibly triggered by a crisis (e.g., a provocative move during an exercise, or an accidental breach of sovereignty)—results in significant casualties, either in a single event or a series of escalating clashes, cumulatively causing at least 100 deaths. The incident is widely reported by credible government and news sources, meeting the question’s criteria for armed conflict with major loss of life.

## Rationale

Current evidence indicates that while military tensions and the risk environment in the Taiwan Strait are at their highest in decades, both Beijing and Taipei continue to exhibit extreme caution regarding direct military engagement. Chinese and Taiwanese analysts, including senior defense figures, stress that the Taiwan Strait is not like other volatile regions (e.g., India-Pakistan), and an exchange resulting in even a single aircraft loss would be seen as catastrophic and highly escalatory by both sides[2][5]. Past patterns confirm that both militaries operate under strict rules of engagement to avoid incidents that could spiral out of control.

Despite a dramatic increase in the frequency and intensity of Chinese military operations—such as record numbers of aircraft crossing the median line, naval encirclements, and continuous live-fire exercises—the PLA’s actions to date have stopped short of direct kinetic engagement with Taiwanese forces[2][5]. This activity is interpreted by analysts as a demonstration of operational readiness and deterrence rather than an immediate prelude to invasion or large-scale armed conflict.

The US military, while preparing for a worst-case scenario and issuing warnings about the potential for catastrophic loss of life if war were to break out, continues to emphasize deterrence and the maintenance of the status quo[5]. Regional actors—including the US and its allies—remain highly alert and have increased their presence and readiness, further raising the threshold for inadvertent escalation.

No credible government or media sources have reported any incident since January 2021 involving an exchange of weapon fire between the national militaries of Taiwan and China resulting in 100 or more deaths. All reporting and expert commentary as of May 2025 concur that the "nightmare scenario" remains hypothetical and—absent a major, unexpected trigger—unlikely to occur in the coming months[2][5].

While the potential for miscalculation or crisis escalation is real and has grown compared to previous years, the world’s recent experience with high-profile conflicts (such as Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza) may also reinforce the incentive for prudent crisis management and restraint by both Beijing and Taipei.

Therefore, unless there is a dramatic, unexpected incident or deliberate shift in policy by one or both parties before January 1, 2026, the most likely outcome is that **no such armed conflict resulting in at least 100 deaths will occur** in the specified period.
