(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months until January 1, 2026, the deadline for this forecasting question.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
As of May 2025, there is no comprehensive, general federal AI regulation law in the US. If existing trends continue—with many bills proposed but none close to passage, ongoing partisan divides, deregulatory executive policies, and industry lobbying focused on preempting state laws—the US will *not* pass a general federal AI regulation bill before January 1, 2026[2][3][5].

(c) **No outcome scenario:**  
Congress continues to debate but fails to agree on a comprehensive AI regulatory framework. AI-related provisions—such as preemption of state laws or sector-specific rules—are debated, sometimes included in larger bills, but are dropped due to parliamentary, political, or lobbying pressures. Efforts remain fragmented, focusing on state-level or sector-specific regulation, patchwork enforcement by existing agencies, and voluntary guidelines rather than binding federal law[1][2][3][5].

(d) **Yes outcome scenario:**  
Bipartisan or technocratic consensus emerges in late 2025, spurred by a major AI-related crisis, intense lobbying from industry and public safety groups, or international pressure (e.g., the EU’s AI Act). Congress swiftly drafts, passes, and the President signs a comprehensive bill with provisions for the oversight, governance, and regulation of AI as a general technology. The bill passes both chambers and becomes law before January 1, 2026, possibly including federal preemption of state regulations[5].

## Rationale

- **Legislative Activity vs. Passage Probability:**  
Federal legislative activity on AI has surged, with hundreds of bills introduced at both state and federal levels in 2024–2025. Despite this, most federal proposals are narrow, fragmented, or focused on sector-specific applications (such as employment, consumer protection, or national security), and no comprehensive general AI regulation is close to enactment[1][2][3][5].

- **Congressional Priorities and Obstacles:**  
The US Congress is showing more interest in AI, but the legislative focus appears split between preempting state regulation (to avoid a fragmented national landscape) and encouraging innovation rather than imposing strict federal mandates. High-profile provisions to ban state AI regulation have been attached to budget and tax bills, but are considered unlikely to survive the legislative process on their own and are not tailored as general regulatory frameworks[5].  
Current Congressional leadership, especially in a Republican-majority House, leans toward light-touch regulation, reflecting industry lobbying and competitiveness concerns[2][3][4][5].

- **Executive Branch Direction:**  
The Trump administration’s policies emphasize deregulation and innovation, having rolled back Biden-era AI regulatory initiatives, and now focus on “enhancing America’s global AI dominance.” This creates further headwinds for any new comprehensive regulatory legislation[2][4].

- **State Momentum and Patchwork Pressure:**  
Several states, such as Colorado and Illinois, are moving ahead with their own AI regulations, but these take effect in 2026 or later and are sparking both industry pushback and pressures for federal preemption, not comprehensive federal rules. Major tech firms are lobbying for preemption but not for broad, substantive federal AI regulation[3][5].

- **Historical and Political Inertia:**  
US legislative action on complex, contentious technology issues is typically slow, especially when bipartisan consensus is lacking. There is little evidence of a political breakthrough in favor of comprehensive, binding federal AI regulation before the deadline[2][5].

- **Catalyst Scenarios:**  
A rapid “Yes” scenario would likely require a triggering crisis or international pressure (e.g., a major AI incident or a diplomatic imperative to align with the EU AI Act), neither of which has clearly materialized as of May 2025.

**Final Probability:**  
Given the above, the default, status quo outcome—a “No”—should be weighted most heavily, as legislative inertia and division are dominant patterns. The probability of a comprehensive, general federal AI regulation bill being passed and signed into law before January 1, 2026, remains **low to moderate**, likely in the **20–35% range**, with the status quo and current signals favoring the low end.

**Probability: 25%**
