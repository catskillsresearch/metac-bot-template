(a) Time left until outcome: 7.5 months (mid-May 2025 until January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, none of the Magnificent Seven stocks have fallen 50% below their all-time highs, though several are experiencing significant year-to-date declines in 2025, with Tesla down 30.4%, Nvidia down 18.9%, Alphabet down 18.5%, Apple down 15.4%, and Amazon down 12.6%.

(c) No outcome scenario: The Magnificent Seven stocks continue to experience volatility but stabilize with modest recoveries through the remainder of 2025. Their valuations, which have already adjusted downward significantly in early 2025, prevent further dramatic declines. While one or two stocks might approach or exceed the 50% threshold (particularly Tesla), fewer than four breach this mark before 2026.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Market sentiment about tech valuations deteriorates further, particularly regarding AI investments. Combined with rising interest rates, slowing earnings growth, and broader macroeconomic concerns, this triggers more aggressive selloffs. Tesla (already down 30.4%), Nvidia (down 18.9%), Alphabet (down 18.5%), and Apple (down 15.4%) all breach the 50% decline threshold before year-end 2025.

The Magnificent Seven stocks are currently experiencing what appears to be a significant correction rather than an outright collapse. As of May 2025, these tech giants have faced a challenging start to the year with substantial declines across the board. Tesla has fallen 28-30.4%, Nvidia 17.2-18.9%, Alphabet 14.9-18.5%, Apple 15.1-15.4%, Amazon 12.2-12.6%, while Microsoft and Meta have been more resilient with declines of around 6.2%[1][2][5].

This represents a notable shift from their previous market dominance. In Q1 2025, the Magnificent Seven experienced their worst quarter on record as a group[5]. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025 alone, and with February's 8% decline, the fund was down more than 15% since the start of the year[5].

Several factors are contributing to this downturn:

1. **Earnings growth deceleration**: While these companies collectively beat earnings estimates in early 2025[3], growth rates are slowing compared to their previous performance.

2. **Valuation concerns**: After years of premium valuations, investors appear to be reassessing the long-term profit potential of significant AI investments.

3. **Macroeconomic uncertainties and trade tensions**: These broader factors have impacted market sentiment toward growth stocks[1].

However, there are several reasons to be cautious about forecasting a complete bubble burst:

1. **Market resilience**: Despite the challenging start to 2025, the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven has shown some recovery, climbing back to $15.4 trillion by May 1, 2025[2].

2. **Varying performance**: Not all seven stocks are equally vulnerable. Tesla shows the most significant decline at 28-30.4%, while Microsoft and Meta have been more stable with less severe losses[1][2].

3. **Status quo bias**: Major market leaders rarely experience synchronized collapses of the magnitude described (four stocks falling 50% below all-time highs) within short timeframes unless triggered by systemic economic crises.

To meet the criteria for a "bubble pop," four of these seven stocks would need to close at least 50% below their all-time highs before January 2026. Even Tesla, the worst performer in the group, is still approximately 20% away from crossing that threshold. While the current trajectory suggests continued pressure on these stocks, the required magnitude of decline for four separate companies over the next 7.5 months represents a significant escalation from current conditions.

Given the status quo, the current valuations after recent corrections, and historical patterns of market behavior, a complete "bubble pop" meeting the specified criteria seems possible but not highly probable within the remaining timeframe of 2025.

Probability: 35%
