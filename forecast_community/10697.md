# Rationale for Electric Vehicle Sales Share in China by 2035

The current momentum in China's electric vehicle market is remarkable, with NEVs (New Energy Vehicles) already accounting for 47.6% of new passenger vehicle sales in 2024, including 27.6% pure battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This rapid growth trajectory has dramatically outpaced earlier forecasts, and has led to a significant revision of expectations for 2035.

## Historical Context and Current Trajectory

China's EV adoption has accelerated tremendously in recent years—growing from merely 5% in 2019 to nearly 48% by 2024. This pace has been so rapid that China is now expected to reach a 50% EV sales share as early as 2025, a full decade ahead of targets set just a few years ago. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that electric car sales in China will reach approximately 10 million in 2024 alone, accounting for about 45% of all car sales in the country.

If this growth trajectory continues, EV sales share in China could reach 70-80% by 2035. Multiple forecasts from institutions like EV-Volumes, BloombergNEF, and the IEA converge on this range based on current trends and policy direction.

## Government Policy and Industry Outlook

The Chinese government has explicitly announced that pure EVs (BEVs) should "dominate" new car sales by 2035. This represents a significant policy acceleration from earlier targets that grouped all NEVs together. The Automotive Industry Green and Low-Carbon Development Roadmap 1.0, developed under the supervision of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, anticipates NEV sales could reach 50% as soon as 2025.

According to forecasts from major financial institutions including UBS, HSBC, Morningstar, and Wood Mackenzie, China's EV sales are expected to hit 12 million units in 2024, representing a 20% jump from 2023. Meanwhile, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales are predicted to fall by 10%, dropping below 11 million units. This crossover point is expected to be reached in 2025, with EVs continuing to surge afterward.

## Long-term Projections

By 2034-2035, electric vehicles could exceed 18 million annual sales in China, while ICE model sales may drop to as low as 2.93 million. According to some industry analyses, EVs are forecast to account for 47.8% of light-vehicle sales in 2025, 69.5% in 2030, and 85% in 2035.

The IEA's analysis suggests that the sales share of EVs across all road transport modes in China will reach around 80% in 2035. Notably, the current market dynamics and policy landscape are already sufficient to align with China's ambition of climate neutrality by 2060, suggesting that even the current projections might be conservative.

## Factors That Could Alter This Trajectory

### Potential Limiting Factors

Several factors could lead to lower-than-expected EV adoption:
- Prolonged supply chain disruptions affecting battery materials
- A major economic downturn in China
- Breakthroughs in alternative clean fuel technologies that divert focus from BEVs
- Battery safety incidents undermining consumer trust
- Trade restrictions limiting Chinese automakers' global scale advantages
- Destructive price wars damaging industry profitability and R&D investment

### Potential Accelerating Factors

Conversely, several developments could push EV adoption even higher:
- Breakthroughs in battery technology (such as solid-state batteries) dramatically reducing costs and extending range
- Stricter environmental regulations and ICE vehicle bans in major cities
- Successful integration of EVs into virtual power plant systems, creating additional economic incentives
- High oil prices or new climate emergencies driving policy acceleration
- Rapid declines in EV costs combined with export restrictions on gasoline vehicles

## Market Consolidation

While EV sales growth is expected to remain strong, increasing competition will likely lead to market consolidation. According to HSBC analyst Yuqian Ding: "While China's domestic EV sector is clearly flourishing, it is also facing slowing growth — from a very high base — models oversupply, intense competition and a price war. The longer-term direction of travel is clear — China's EV juggernaut is unstoppable."
