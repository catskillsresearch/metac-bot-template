The outcome of the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty by 2030 is influenced by several key factors. Currently, the World Bank predicts that approximately 622 million people will live in extreme poverty by 2030, translating to about 7.3% of the projected global population of 8.5 billion. This prediction reflects a continuation of the trend of decreasing extreme poverty, albeit at a slower pace than in previous decades. Experts and markets generally expect this decline to persist, but they acknowledge significant challenges that could hinder progress, such as economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, and climate change.

In a scenario where global economic growth accelerates due to technological advancements and effective poverty alleviation policies, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty could decrease significantly. This would require substantial investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, particularly in low-income regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, and successful international cooperation.

Conversely, a severe global economic downturn, potentially exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts, climate change impacts, or a major pandemic, could reverse progress and increase the percentage of the world population living in extreme poverty. Such a scenario would likely lead to reduced economic opportunities and increased inequality, particularly affecting vulnerable regions.

Overall, while the trend suggests a continued decline in extreme poverty, the pace of this decline and the final outcome will depend heavily on global economic conditions, policy effectiveness, and the ability to address emerging challenges.
