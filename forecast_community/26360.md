# Rationale for World War III Probability Following AGI Development

The question of whether World War III will occur within five years after the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires careful analysis of historical patterns, current geopolitical tensions, and the potential impact of AGI on global security dynamics.

## Historical Context and Current Trends

Since 1945, the world has not experienced a conflict meeting the high threshold for World War III (defined as ≥10 million deaths AND involving countries representing ≥30% of world GDP or ≥50% of world population). This remarkable 80-year peace between major powers has persisted despite numerous regional conflicts, technological revolutions, and periods of intense geopolitical tension.

Recent survey data from 2025 indicates growing concern about global conflict. Between 41% and 55% of Europeans and approximately 45% of Americans believe another world war is likely within the next 5-10 years, with most expecting nuclear weapons would be used. Similarly, an Atlantic Council survey found that 40.5% of international affairs experts predict a world war involving major powers by 2035.

However, public and expert perception often overestimates the likelihood of dramatic events compared to their historical frequency. The resilience of peace between major powers suggests significant inertia against full-scale world war.

## AGI as a Potential Destabilizing Factor

AGI represents a potentially transformative technology that could significantly affect international security through several mechanisms:

1. **Disruption of nuclear deterrence**: AGI might enable advances in anti-missile defense or cyberwarfare that undermine the stability provided by mutually assured destruction.

2. **Acceleration of military capabilities**: AGI could rapidly advance military technologies, creating perceived first-mover advantages that incentivize preemptive action.

3. **Compressed decision timeframes**: Military applications of AGI could dramatically reduce decision windows, increasing the risk of miscalculation.

4. **Multipolar bargaining failure**: AGI systems might fail to make compatible demands in high-stakes negotiations, potentially triggering "flash wars" where autonomous systems make rapid escalatory decisions.

5. **Power transitions**: If AGI gives one nation a decisive strategic advantage, it could destabilize the international order, similar to historical power transitions that have often led to conflict.

## Mitigating Factors

Several factors could reduce the likelihood of World War III following AGI development:

1. **Recognition of risks**: Major powers increasingly recognize the dangers posed by AGI, potentially leading to new arms control or confidence-building measures.

2. **Improved diplomacy**: AGI might enhance diplomatic efforts, identify mutually beneficial solutions to conflicts, and provide early warning of potential escalations.

3. **Economic interdependence**: The high level of economic integration between major powers creates strong incentives to avoid catastrophic conflict.

4. **Governance frameworks**: The development of robust governance mechanisms for AGI could significantly reduce risks.

5. **Enhanced verification**: AGI might improve monitoring and verification of arms control agreements, reducing security dilemmas.

## Development Pathways and Key Uncertainties

The timeline to AGI remains uncertain. While some AI leaders from organizations like DeepMind, OpenAI, and Nvidia have suggested AGI could arrive within 5-10 years, there remains significant disagreement among experts.

Several critical uncertainties affect this forecast:

1. **AGI development timeline and trajectory**: A gradual development with international cooperation would likely pose less risk than sudden breakthroughs by individual actors.

2. **Initial applications**: Whether AGI is first applied to military or civilian domains will affect its impact on international security.

3. **Distribution of capabilities**: Whether AGI capabilities are widely distributed or concentrated among a few actors will affect power dynamics.

4. **Speed of institutional adaptation**: How quickly international institutions and governance frameworks adapt to AGI will be crucial in managing risks.

## The High Threshold for World War III

Reaching the defined threshold for World War III - at least 10 million deaths and involvement of countries representing either 30% of world GDP or 50% of world population - sets an extremely high bar that has not been approached since 1945. Escalation to this scale would require failure across multiple layers of control—human, institutional, and technological—and remains improbable despite increased risks.

Weighing the historical resilience of international stability against the unprecedented nature of AGI as a potentially destabilizing technology, the probability of World War III occurring within five years after AGI development is approximately 15-25%.
