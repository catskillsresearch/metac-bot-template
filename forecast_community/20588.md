## Rationale for the Probability of War Between Western Countries Before 2070

Western countries have experienced an unparalleled period of peace among themselves since 1945, often referred to as the "Long Peace." This stability is rooted in several reinforcing mechanisms: dense alliance networks (notably NATO and the EU), deep economic interdependence, widespread adherence to democratic governance, and strong cultural and historical ties. These factors not only deter conflict but create shared frameworks for cooperation and peaceful dispute resolution.

### Structural Foundations of Peace

- **Institutional Integration:** Western nations are bound together through robust formal institutions like NATO and the EU, which facilitate regular diplomatic engagement, coordinate defense, and offer collective security guarantees. Institutional density allows for disputes to be managed through dialogue and negotiation, significantly reducing the risk of escalation to open conflict.

- **Economic Entanglement:** Trade, investment, and integrated supply chains among Western nations make the cost of war extraordinarily high. The prosperity of these societies is interconnected, providing strong incentives to avoid actions that would disrupt mutual economic well-being.

- **Shared Democratic Norms:** Liberal democracy, rule of law, and open societies are dominant across the Western world. Democracies have shown a strong historical tendency not to wage war against each other, and these shared values reinforce a collective identity that further lowers the risk of conflict.

- **Common External Threats:** Military preparations and increased defense spending in recent years have been aimed squarely at external actors—most notably Russia, whose actions in Ukraine have actually strengthened intra-Western cohesion and prompted further alliance expansion (e.g., Finland and Sweden joining NATO). Internal security concerns or rivalries among Western countries remain absent.

### Risk Factors and Uncertainties

Despite these strong peace-preserving structures, looking ahead to 2070 requires recognizing significant sources of uncertainty:

- **Institutional Decay or Collapse:** The most plausible pathway to intra-Western war would be the dramatic failure or fragmentation of existing institutions, such as a collapse of NATO or the EU. This could be triggered by severe global economic depression, political realignment toward nationalism or authoritarianism, or the rise of regimes willing to abandon long-standing commitments.

- **Democratic Backsliding and Populism:** Should key Western nations experience substantial democratic erosion, leading to the rise of illiberal or ultranationalist governments, former allies could become rivals and old taboos against conflict could erode.

- **Technological and Economic Shocks:** Black swan events—such as disruptive new military technologies, catastrophic cyber incidents, or resource scarcity driven by climate change—could create conditions where old alliances fray and new disputes arise.

- **Geopolitical Realignment:** The international order could change in unforeseen ways, possibly shifting threat perceptions within the Western bloc or creating new points of contention over territory, resources, or leadership.

However, historical precedent strongly favors the persistence of the status quo. Even during major global upheavals since 1945—including financial crises, the end of the Cold War, and major transitions within the European Union—Western countries have resolved disputes peacefully and maintained alliance solidarity. The absence of any serious disputes or military build-ups directed at fellow Western states, combined with the prohibitive costs (both military and economic) of such conflict, anchor expectations that this pattern will endure barring unprecedented systemic breakdown.

### Weight of the Status Quo

Forecasting principles dictate giving substantial weight to the continuation of deeply rooted trends, especially when backed by strong institutions and the lack of compelling evidence for reversal. Western states' military and political focus remains external, and defense postures are coordinated rather than competitive within the group. While "black swan" risks cannot be ruled out over a 45-year horizon, there are currently no credible signs of rising intra-Western rivalry or the sort of institutional decay that could make war plausible.

In summary, unless there is an extraordinary collapse of the Western alliance architectures, a profound shift in domestic politics, or an unpredictable technological or geopolitical shock, the probability of war between Western countries remains extremely low through 2070. The continued functioning of cooperative institutions, economic and societal integration, and shared democratic values form a remarkably resilient foundation for peace within the Western world.
