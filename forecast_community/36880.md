(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**  
There are about 7 months and 3 weeks remaining until January 1, 2026, which is the deadline for legislation to be enacted that would eliminate the transferability of any of the specified clean energy tax credits.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed**  
If no further legislative action occurs, the transferability of the §48E (ITC), §45Y (PTC), and §45X (AMPC) tax credits will continue as currently authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act and associated IRS regulations[3][5]. Transferability remains available for qualifying entities for tax years including 2026.

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**  
A No outcome arises if, by January 1, 2026, Congress does not pass, and the President does not sign, legislation that eliminates the transferability of any of these credits. This could occur even if legislative debate continues or if Congress passes other modifications to the credits (such as reducing rates, accelerating phase-outs, or restricting eligibility) but does not touch the transferability provisions themselves[1][4].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**  
A Yes outcome requires that, before January 1, 2026, Congress and the President enact a law that specifically eliminates the ability to transfer (sell) at least one of these tax credits (§48E, §45Y, §45X). This could be accomplished by full repeal of one or more credits, or by amending the Internal Revenue Code (specifically, Section 6418 or related provisions) to remove or substantially limit the statutory transferability for newly awarded credits[1][4].

## Rationale

- **Status Quo Advantage:** There is strong inertia behind the legislative status quo. Historically, large-scale repeal or reversal of major tax provisions within a few years of enactment is rare and difficult, even with single-party control, due to industry opposition, economic impacts, and stakeholder adaptation[1][3].
- **Congressional Complexity:** While the new administration and congressional majorities have publicly considered rolling back IRA credits and specifically debated the possibility of targeting transferability, there is no evidence—public reporting, IRS guidance, or finalized legislation as of May 2025—that such action has been taken[1][3][4].
- **Legislative Process:** Budget reconciliation is the likeliest pathway for changes, but even in that process, negotiations often lead to partial rather than full rollbacks. Stakeholder influence and the attractiveness of transferability (which cuts project finance costs and aids economic development in red and blue states alike) provide significant political barriers to outright elimination[1].
- **Market Forces:** The transferability market is rapidly expanding, with projections of $50B in deals in 2025 and up to $100B in 2026[5]. Many projects in the pipeline and substantial industry investments rely on these rules, making sudden regulatory whiplash risky and less probable.
- **Precedents:** If changes are enacted, historical precedent suggests they would likely apply prospectively (to projects started or credits earned after a future date) rather than retroactively, and outright repeal of transferability seems less likely than other forms of credit reductions or modifications[1].

## Final Probability Estimate

Given the above—strong status quo inertia; no enacted legislation as of May 2025; complex, multi-faceted stakeholder interests; and ongoing, but not yet conclusive, negotiations—the most likely outcome is that transferability will **not** be eliminated before January 1, 2026.

**Probability: 20%**
