# Q1 2025 GDP Growth: Third Estimate Analysis

The third estimate for Q1 2025 real GDP growth will be released on June 26, 2025, approximately three weeks from now. Currently, the data shows a contractionary economic environment, with the advance estimate reporting -0.3% and the second estimate showing a slight improvement to -0.2%.

## Historical Revision Patterns

Third estimates typically incorporate incremental, late-arriving data that rarely produces dramatic shifts in the headline number. Revisions between the second and third estimates are usually modest—often within +/- 0.1 percentage points—unless there is a significant data anomaly or major new information. The historical tendency when both earlier estimates are negative is for the third estimate to remain negative, even with small upward adjustments.

## Current Economic Context

The contraction in Q1 2025 has been primarily attributed to two main factors:

1. **Elevated imports** contributed -5.0 percentage points to GDP growth, representing the largest drag on the economy. This surge in imports likely reflects businesses frontrunning Trump's import tariffs, also corroborated by the largest build in private inventories (2.3 percentage points) since Q4 2021.

2. **Government spending cuts** subtracted 0.3 percentage points from growth, partially reflecting the impact of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) which has terminated approximately $32 billion in contracts, $37 billion in grants, and $291 million in leases as of May 3rd, 2025.

These negative factors were partially offset by positive contributions from investment (3.6 percentage points), consumer spending on services (1.1 percentage points), exports (0.2 percentage points), and consumer spending on goods (0.1 percentage points).

## Scenarios for the Third Estimate

For the third estimate to show positive growth (above 0%), we would need to see unexpectedly positive late-arriving data in one or more key components:

- A significant upward revision in trade figures
- A larger-than-expected inventory build
- Substantial positive adjustments to consumer or government spending

However, no such indications have emerged in recent economic reporting or analyst commentary. The underlying economic data that has been incorporated into the second estimate already captures most of the relevant information for the quarter.

## Outlook

Given that both the advance and second estimates show contraction, the direction of revision has been modestly upward (from -0.3% to -0.2%), and there is no evidence of major late-breaking positive data, the most probable outcome is that the third estimate will remain in negative territory. While a further small upward revision is possible—perhaps to -0.1% or closer to zero—a swing into positive territory would represent an unusually large and historically uncommon revision at this stage.

The underlying causes of the Q1 contraction appear well-established in the data, and these trends are unlikely to be dramatically revised in the final estimate. The economic context aligns with a modest contraction followed by potential rebounds in subsequent quarters, as indicated by forecasters who predict slower but still positive growth for the full year 2025.
