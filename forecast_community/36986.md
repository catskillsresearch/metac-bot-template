(a) Time left until outcome: 46 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 28, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Jeff Bezos would remain in second place according to Forbes' May 2025 data.
(c) Unexpected scenario: A significant drop in Tesla stock combined with strong performance of Meta/Facebook could result in Elon Musk falling to second place while Mark Zuckerberg rises to first.

Based on the search results and recent news, I'll provide my professional assessment of who is likely to occupy second place in the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on June 28, 2025.

## Current Billionaire Rankings

As of May 2025, the top billionaires according to Forbes' Real-Time list are:

1. Elon Musk - $386.5 billion (increased by $46 billion in April)[1]
2. Jeff Bezos - $201.6 billion (according to May 11, 2025 data)
3. Mark Zuckerberg - $190-$212 billion (sources vary)
4. Larry Ellison - $176.9 billion
5. Warren Buffett - $166.4 billion

However, there's significant volatility in these positions. According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index (not Forbes), Mark Zuckerberg has just surpassed Jeff Bezos for the #2 position as of May 5, 2025, with a net worth of $212 billion compared to Bezos's declining wealth.

## Key Factors Affecting the June 28 Ranking

**Stock Market Performance**: The wealth of these billionaires is primarily tied to their companies' stock performance. Tesla, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle stock fluctuations will be the primary determinants of the June ranking.

**Economic Conditions**: The search results mention market volatility in response to President Trump's tariff plans and recession concerns, which could disproportionately affect different billionaires depending on their portfolio composition.

**Recent Trends**: Elon Musk's wealth increased significantly ($46 billion) in April 2025, while Jeff Bezos saw a drop in Amazon's stock price (4% in April). Mark Zuckerberg has been gaining ground rapidly.

## Analysis of Top Contenders

**Mark Zuckerberg**: His wealth has been on an upward trajectory, recently surpassing Bezos according to Bloomberg (though not yet in Forbes' ranking). Meta's investments in AI and increased revenue forecasts ($42.5-45.5 billion for Q2) suggest continued growth potential.

**Jeff Bezos**: Currently holds the #2 position in Forbes but is showing signs of slipping. Amazon has experienced some stock price decline recently, and Bezos has moved to Florida, potentially indicating lifestyle changes that might affect his business focus.

**Larry Ellison**: His wealth increased by $1.9 billion in April due to Oracle's stock performance and his involvement in AI infrastructure development. While currently in fourth place, he has the potential to move up if tech sector trends continue.

**Elon Musk**: While firmly in first place now, Tesla stock is notoriously volatile. Any significant drop could potentially move him to second place, though the gap between him and others is substantial ($386.5B vs ~$200B).

**Warren Buffett**: Reports indicate he will retire at the end of 2025, which could affect Berkshire Hathaway's stock price. His diversified portfolio offers stability but typically slower growth than tech-focused billionaires.

## Forecast Rationale

The second position on June 28 will likely be determined by:

1. The relative performance of Amazon vs. Meta stock over the next 46 days
2. Whether Tesla maintains its strong position, keeping Musk firmly in first
3. Oracle's performance in the AI infrastructure space

Mark Zuckerberg appears to have momentum, having just overtaken Bezos according to Bloomberg. However, Forbes' methodology may differ slightly, and the status quo (Bezos at #2) remains a strong possibility given the relatively small gap between their fortunes.

While the unexpected scenario of Musk dropping to second is possible, it would require a massive decline in Tesla stock (over $180 billion) or extraordinary growth from whoever would take first place.

Larry Ellison shows growing wealth but would need significant gains to overcome the approximately $25 billion gap with Zuckerberg and Bezos.

## Final Probabilities

Larry Ellison: 12%
Elon Musk: 6%
Mark Zuckerberg: 42%
Warren Buffett: 3%
Jeff Bezos: 35%
Someone else: 2%
