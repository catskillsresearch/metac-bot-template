# Assessing the Risk of Non-State Nuclear Terrorism by 2030

The probability of a non-state actor causing at least one fatality through a non-test nuclear detonation by 2030 remains very low, though not zero. This assessment is supported by several key factors that consistently limit the feasibility of such an event.

## Historical Precedent and Current Status

No non-state actor has ever successfully acquired and detonated a nuclear device causing fatalities. Despite decades of interest from terrorist organizations, none have overcome the formidable technical, logistical, and security barriers involved. The strong historical pattern of zero successful non-state nuclear detonations provides a solid baseline suggesting this status quo will likely continue.

As of mid-2025, there have been no credible near-misses or significant reports of compromised nuclear security involving non-state actors. The 2025 Global Nuclear Threat Update continues to assess this risk as low but acknowledges it cannot be completely dismissed.

## Pathways and Barriers to Acquisition

Two primary scenarios exist for non-state actors to obtain nuclear capabilities:

1. **Theft of an intact nuclear weapon** from a state arsenal - Nuclear weapons storage facilities are among the most heavily guarded sites in the world. Weapons incorporate multiple layers of physical security, electronic safeguards, and security features designed to prevent unauthorized use.

2. **Construction of an improvised nuclear device** using stolen fissile material - This would require a non-state actor to:
   - Acquire sufficient quantities of weapons-grade fissile material (HEU or plutonium)
   - Possess technical expertise to design a functioning device
   - Access specialized equipment and facilities
   - Avoid detection by intelligence agencies throughout the process

Both pathways face extraordinary obstacles that have proven insurmountable to date.

## Current Security Measures

The Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration's 2025-2029 strategic framework explicitly focuses on preventing non-state actors from acquiring nuclear materials, countering development efforts, and maintaining readiness to respond to emergencies. Their approach prioritizes:

1. Preventing proliferant states and non-state actors from acquiring nuclear materials, equipment, technology, and expertise
2. Countering efforts to acquire, develop, or use components of nuclear devices
3. Responding to nuclear emergencies to minimize potential damage

International cooperation on nuclear security remains robust, with intelligence sharing and coordinated counter-proliferation efforts serving as critical barriers to non-state acquisition attempts.

## Potential Risk Factors

Despite the low overall probability, several factors warrant monitoring:

- Political instability in nuclear-armed states could potentially create security vulnerabilities
- Ongoing nuclear modernization programs might temporarily create security gaps
- Insider threats remain a persistent concern at nuclear facilities
- Advances in technology might gradually lower some technical barriers

However, as of mid-2025, none of these factors has qualitatively shifted the risk landscape. While there are ongoing geopolitical tensions and nuclear modernization efforts by state actors, these don't directly increase the likelihood of non-state nuclear terrorism in the near term.

## Geopolitical Context

Current global concerns focus primarily on state-level nuclear developments rather than non-state threats. The 2025 NPT Preparatory Committee highlighted concerns about continued investment in nuclear capabilities by nuclear weapons states, while debates continue about forward deployment of non-strategic nuclear weapons. These developments, while important for global security, don't significantly alter the barriers facing non-state actors.

## Conclusion

Given the continued effectiveness of nuclear security measures, the absence of credible near-misses in recent history, and the immense technical challenges involved, the likelihood of a non-state actor successfully detonating a nuclear device causing fatalities by 2030 remains very low. While acknowledging that unexpected developments could change this assessment, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests the status quo of non-occurrence will persist through 2030.
