(a) Time left until outcome: 7 months and 18 days (until December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Currently, there are no domestic restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or corporations can purchase, manufacture, or possess in the US.

(c) No outcome scenario: The US continues to focus on international export controls rather than domestic compute capacity restrictions. The current regulations targeting international transfers and AI model weights remain in place, but no absolute caps on domestic compute ownership are implemented.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The US government expands its computational resource regulation beyond international transfers to include absolute domestic limits, potentially citing national security concerns, AI safety risks, or energy/environmental considerations.

Based on the search results and current policy trajectory, I can provide a comprehensive forecast analysis on whether the US will place restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or companies before 2026.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

As of May 2025, the US has implemented significant restrictions on the international transfer of advanced computing resources, particularly those related to AI development, but has not yet placed absolute limits on domestic compute capacity ownership.

The most relevant regulations were implemented in January 2025, when the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published an "AI Diffusion Framework" that:

1. Expanded controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs) that could enable AI applications of national security concern[1]

2. Introduced a novel "Total Performance Power" (TPP) quota system limiting where and how computing power can be deployed internationally[5]

3. Established controls on AI model weights for models trained with significant computational resources[2]

4. Created tiered systems of Validated End Users for data centers developing AI capabilities[5]

These regulations took effect in January 2025, with compliance required by May 15, 2025[2] - just two days after today's date.

## Key Considerations for Forecasting

Several factors are important to consider when predicting whether the US will implement domestic compute capacity restrictions before 2026:

### Factors Supporting a "YES" Outcome:

1. **Precedent for Quantified Limits**: The government has already established the TPP framework to quantify and limit computational resources in international contexts[5], which could be adapted for domestic use.

2. **Expanding Regulatory Scope**: The January 2025 regulations significantly expanded the geographic coverage of advanced computing item controls[2], showing a willingness to broaden restrictions.

3. **Growing National Security Concerns**: The underlying rationale for export controls - preventing adversaries from accessing AI compute to build frontier models[5] - could eventually extend to domestic security concerns.

4. **Recent Political Developments**: Recent news suggests potential shifts in US policy. While some reports indicate the Trump administration plans to rescind certain AI chip export curbs, this doesn't necessarily mean domestic restrictions won't be considered for different reasons.

### Factors Supporting a "NO" Outcome:

1. **Focus on International Transfers**: Current regulatory efforts have consistently targeted international transfers rather than domestic ownership[2][4], representing a fundamentally different approach.

2. **Economic and Innovation Concerns**: Domestic compute restrictions would likely face significant opposition from US technology companies concerned about innovation and competitiveness.

3. **Regulatory Direction**: The "AI Diffusion Framework" establishes a pattern of controlling international flows while creating exceptions for authorized entities[5], rather than imposing blanket domestic caps.

4. **Political Resistance**: Absolute restrictions on domestic compute capacity would represent a significant departure from traditional US market principles and likely face substantial political resistance.

5. **Limited Time Window**: With only 7.5 months remaining before the end of 2025, the process of developing, proposing, receiving public comment on, and implementing such significant new domestic regulations would be challenging.

## Status Quo Analysis

The status quo strongly favors a "NO" outcome. Currently, US policy allows unlimited domestic compute capacity ownership while controlling international transfers. To reach a "YES" outcome would require:

1. A significant regulatory shift from international controls to domestic ownership caps
2. Development of a new regulatory framework for domestic compute restrictions
3. Navigating substantial political and industry opposition
4. Completing the entire regulatory process within the remaining months of 2025

While recent years have seen unprecedented government intervention in AI development, the specific type of absolute restriction described in the question represents a major departure from current policy direction.

## Conclusion

The most likely outcome is that the US will continue to refine its international transfer restrictions on advanced computing resources while maintaining its current policy of allowing unrestricted domestic compute capacity ownership. The existing regulatory framework is focused on controlling international flows of computing resources rather than capping domestic ownership, and a shift to the latter would represent a significant policy change that would be difficult to implement within the remaining months of 2025.

While the government has demonstrated willingness to regulate AI development in novel ways, the specific form of restriction described in the question - absolute caps on domestic compute capacity - remains considerably less likely than continued focus on international controls and authorized user frameworks.
