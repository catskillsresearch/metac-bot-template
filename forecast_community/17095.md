# Compute Capacity Restrictions in the US: Analyzing the Potential for Regulation Before 2026

The question of whether the US will place restrictions on total compute capacity for individuals or companies before 2026 requires careful consideration of current regulatory trends, technical feasibility, and broader policy objectives.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

The US has substantially expanded its approach to regulating advanced computing and AI systems. In January 2025, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) published an Interim Final Rule implementing the "Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion," which took effect on January 13, 2025, with compliance required by May 15, 2025.

This framework established several significant mechanisms:
- Enhanced export controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs)
- New controls on AI model weights
- Introduction of Total Processing Performance (TPP) quotas for international distribution
- A tiered security framework for authorizing access to advanced US AI technology

Critically, these regulations are exclusively export-focused, targeting "exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country)" rather than imposing any domestic possession limits. The US has positioned its cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud) as privileged channels for global AI compute diffusion, suggesting a strategy focused on maintaining US technological leadership.

## Technical Infrastructure for Potential Restrictions

While current regulations focus on international transfers, several elements could serve as precursors to domestic restrictions:

1. **Technical Framework Development**: The implementation of TPP quotas demonstrates that the government has developed technical and administrative frameworks for measuring and restricting compute capacity. This infrastructure could theoretically be extended to domestic regulation.

2. **Expanding Regulatory Scope**: The US has expanded from hardware-focused controls to also regulating AI model weights themselves, showing an increasing willingness to directly regulate AI capabilities.

3. **National Security Framing**: The regulations consistently frame advanced computing as a national security concern, which could potentially justify domestic restrictions in the future.

## Factors Against Domestic Restrictions

Several compelling factors suggest domestic compute restrictions remain unlikely before 2026:

1. **Economic Impact Concerns**: Restricting domestic compute capacity would directly impact US technological competitiveness in AI development. Industry forecasts indicate enormous growth in compute demand, with total Datacenter Critical IT Power demand projected to double from about 49 GW in 2023 to 96 GW by 2026, with 90% of the growth coming from AI-related demand.

2. **Recent Policy Direction**: There are indications that the Trump administration plans to rescind some AI chip export curbs introduced by the Biden administration, focusing instead on direct negotiations with specific nations. This suggests a potential move away from broad restrictions toward more targeted approaches.

3. **Energy Infrastructure Investment**: Significant investments in energy infrastructure to support expanding AI compute capacity indicate a focus on enabling rather than restricting domestic compute growth.

4. **Industry Opposition**: Major tech companies would likely mount significant opposition to domestic possession limits, arguing such restrictions would harm innovation and economic growth.

5. **Implementation Challenges**: Creating and enforcing domestic possession limits would face substantial technical, legal, and administrative hurdles within the remaining timeframe of 2025, especially considering that compliance with the current framework was only required since May 15, 2025.

## Growth Trajectory and Infrastructure Challenges

The scale of AI compute clusters is growing dramatically. Up until recently, the largest clusters had tens of thousands of GPUs and power consumption in the tens of megawatts. The largest clusters being built today are 10x bigger with around one hundred thousand GPUs consuming hundreds of MW of power. Looking further ahead, clusters being planned are 10x bigger still, with closer to a million GPUs consuming several gigawatts of power.

This exponential growth creates significant infrastructure challenges. In the U.S., home to 33% of the world's data centers, electricity consumption is expected to rise from 200TWh in 2022 to 260TWh in 2026. Electricity supply is increasingly viewed as the most acutely binding constraint on expanded US computational capacity.

## Conclusion

The US has demonstrated willingness to regulate advanced computing technologies, but has consistently framed these efforts in terms of preventing specific foreign entities from accessing US technology rather than limiting domestic usage. This pattern suggests that maintaining US technological leadership remains a higher priority than imposing domestic compute restrictions.

While the technical infrastructure for regulating compute capacity exists, extending it to domestic possession would represent a significant policy shift with substantial economic and political implications. Without a precipitating crisis or major national security event, such a dramatic shift in regulatory approach seems unlikely within the next seven months.

The establishment of TPP quotas and the AI Diffusion Framework does create precedent for quantitative limits on compute resources, but expanding these to domestic possession would require overcoming substantial industry opposition and implementation challenges within a relatively short timeframe.
