As a professional forecaster interviewing for this position, I'll analyze the likelihood of an application to ban the AfD being filed at the Federal Constitutional Court before 2026.

(a) Time until outcome is known: 7.5 months (from May 13, 2025 to January 1, 2026)

(b) Status quo outcome: No formal application has been filed yet at the Federal Constitutional Court to ban AfD, despite previous attempts to build momentum for such an action.

(c) No outcome scenario: The legal challenges against the "extremist" designation succeed, reducing the urgency for a ban application. The government continues to prefer political containment over legal prohibition, especially given Chancellor Merz's stated concerns about banning a party with millions of voters. The procedural hurdles and political calculations delay any formal application until after 2026.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: The extremist designation is upheld in court, providing stronger legal grounds. Mass demonstrations continue to build public pressure. A cross-party coalition in the Bundestag successfully builds a majority and files an application by late 2025, viewing the extremist designation as the critical legal foundation they needed.

## Recent Developments Significantly Increase Ban Likelihood

The most significant recent development is the May 2, 2025 classification of the AfD as an "extremist group" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution)[1][3]. This formal designation represents a critical shift from the previous "suspected extremist" status and substantially strengthens the legal basis for a potential ban application.

The Christian Science Monitor reports this "bombshell move" has "opened the door to the extraordinary possibility of outlawing the nation's second most popular party"[1]. The agency specifically cited the AfD's anti-immigrant rhetoric and activities as violating the constitutional demand for "human dignity"[1].

## Legal Framework and Requirements

Germany has a unique constitutional mechanism designed to defend democracy against anti-democratic forces, often referred to as "militant democracy"[1]. Article 21(2) of Germany's Basic Law specifically allows for the prohibition of parties that seek to undermine the democratic constitutional order.

For a ban application to proceed to the Federal Constitutional Court, one of three constitutional bodies must file it:
1. The Federal Government
2. The Bundestag (requiring a majority vote)
3. The Bundesrat (requiring a majority vote)

## Evidence of Momentum Building

The search results indicate significant momentum building toward a ban application:

1. **Pre-existing parliamentary initiative**: A cross-party group of lawmakers led by Marco Wanderwitz (CDU) had previously worked on a ban initiative.

2. **Widespread demonstrations**: Thousands of people have been demonstrating in over 60 German cities explicitly calling for an AfD ban, with slogans like "AfD-Verbot jetzt" (AfD ban now)[3].

3. **Political statements**: Some politicians are explicitly connecting the extremist designation to ban proceedings. SPD parliamentarian Carmen Wegge stated, "We must now file this petition, otherwise it will be too late to protect democracy."

## Barriers and Complications

Despite this momentum, several factors could prevent a ban application before 2026:

1. **Legal challenges**: The AfD has filed an emergency application against the extremist designation, and the Federal Office has agreed not to publicly label the AfD as extremist until the court resolves this challenge.

2. **Political hesitation**: Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed caution about banning a party with 10 million voters, stating that the AfD "cannot be banned" and that the government should focus on addressing the underlying causes of support.

3. **Procedural complexity**: Building sufficient parliamentary support and preparing comprehensive legal documentation requires time.

## Historical Precedents

Previous attempts to ban political parties in Germany have faced significant hurdles:

- In 2003, an attempt to ban the far-right NPD failed due to procedural issues.
- A second attempt in 2017 was rejected because the court ruled that while the party's goals were unconstitutional, it lacked sufficient political significance.

The AfD differs significantly from the NPD case because it has achieved substantial electoral success and now has an official "extremist" designation.

## Probability Assessment

The extremist designation in May 2025 represents a critical inflection point that substantially increases the likelihood of a ban application. The designation provides stronger legal grounds and has catalyzed public demonstrations and political momentum.

However, I must weigh this against the status quo bias - the fact that no application has been filed yet despite years of concern about the AfD, and that such applications face significant procedural hurdles. Additionally, there are clear political hesitations from figures like Chancellor Merz.

Given the 7.5 month timeframe, the recent extremist designation, the widespread demonstrations, and the pre-existing parliamentary initiative, but also considering the legal challenges and political hesitations, I assess:

Probability: 65%
