# Bulgaria-Turkey Botas Gas Agreement: Cancellation Prospects by July 1, 2025

The 13-year gas agreement between Bulgaria's state-controlled gas supplier Bulgargaz and Turkey's BOTAS is in a precarious state. Signed in January 2023, this agreement gives Bulgaria access to Turkish gas infrastructure and LNG terminals, with an obligation to import 1.85 billion cubic meters per year.

## Current Financial Crisis

The agreement is causing significant financial strain for Bulgaria. As of May 2025, Bulgargaz:

- Is not importing gas under the agreement with BOTAS
- Owes approximately 300 million Bulgarian Lev (€150 million) to BOTAS
- Is obligated to pay approximately 1 million leva per day for reserved capacity, regardless of usage

This "take or pay" clause is particularly problematic, as it requires Bulgaria to make payments even when not utilizing the Turkish infrastructure. The Bulgarian state-owned company has not been making payments to BOTAS since July 2024, with the debt continuing to accumulate.

## Political Pressure and Diplomatic Efforts

The situation has escalated to the highest political levels:

- Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has directly told Turkish President Erdogan that "Bulgaria needs out of the Botas Gas Deal," calling it "extremely unfavorable" for Bulgaria
- Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov has publicly criticized the contract, stating he would not have approved it had he been in office at the time
- Renegotiation efforts were underway as of early May 2025, with energy ministers from both countries meeting in Istanbul on May 2, 2025, though no breakthrough was announced

## Factors Supporting Potential Cancellation

Several elements suggest cancellation could occur before July 1:

- **Direct high-level discussions**: The Prime Minister's personal intervention with President Erdogan indicates the seriousness of Bulgaria's intent to exit the deal
- **Financial unsustainability**: The accumulated debt threatens Bulgargaz's viability, with reports suggesting the company is "on the verge of bankruptcy"
- **Ongoing non-usage**: Bulgaria continues to incur costs for infrastructure it is not using, creating political pressure
- **Upcoming Eurozone membership**: Bulgaria has received approval to join the Eurozone in January 2026, which may increase pressure to resolve outstanding financial issues

## Factors Against Imminent Cancellation

However, several countervailing factors suggest the agreement may persist beyond July 1:

- **Diplomatic considerations**: Abruptly cancelling a major international agreement could damage Bulgaria-Turkey relations
- **Legal complexities**: The agreement likely contains termination clauses and potential penalties that make immediate cancellation challenging
- **Ongoing negotiations**: Both countries appear to be in active discussions to renegotiate rather than terminate the agreement outright
- **Historical precedent**: International energy agreements are typically renegotiated rather than unilaterally cancelled
- **No formal cancellation announcement**: Despite public criticism, there has been no official announcement of intent to cancel as of June 6, 2025
- **Short timeframe**: With only 24 days remaining until July 1, bureaucratic and diplomatic processes may not allow for formal cancellation

## Most Likely Scenarios

The most likely scenario appears to be continued negotiations without formal termination by July 1. Bulgaria, under financial and political pressure, will likely seek to renegotiate terms or temporarily suspend specific obligations but stop short of a full, public cancellation. The status quo—continuing negotiations while the agreement remains technically in force—is the most probable near-term outcome, even as Bulgaria continues to withhold payments and seeks better terms.

For cancellation to occur before July 1, we would need to see a rapid escalation, such as a formal declaration by either government that the agreement is terminated, or a severe financial crisis at Bulgargaz triggering government intervention leading to forced termination.

The financial situation is clearly unsustainable for Bulgaria in the long term, but the diplomatic, legal, and practical complexities involved make an official cancellation within the next 24 days less likely than continued attempts at renegotiation.
