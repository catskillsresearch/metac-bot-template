# AOC Endorsement Analysis for NYC Mayoral Primary

With just over five weeks remaining until the June 24, 2025 Democratic primary, political watchers are closely monitoring whether Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse a candidate in the NYC mayoral race. As a highly influential progressive figure, AOC's endorsement could potentially reshape the contest, though recent analysis suggests the window for maximum impact may be closing.

## Current State of the Race

Andrew Cuomo currently leads the polls as the frontrunner, while the progressive vote remains split among multiple candidates. The Working Families Party has endorsed several progressive candidates without settling on a single choice, including Brad Lander, Zohran Mamdani, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and State Sen. Zellnor Myrie.

AOC has explicitly ruled out endorsing Andrew Cuomo, describing him as representing "the weight of the past" rather than "new leadership". This aligns with her consistent positioning on the left of the Democratic Party and her history of supporting progressive candidates.

## Leading Progressive Contenders

Two candidates have emerged as the most likely recipients of an AOC endorsement:

**Zohran Mamdani:**
- Shares Democratic Socialists of America affiliation with AOC
- Currently polling second to Cuomo according to some reports
- Has received Working Families Party endorsement (though not exclusively)
- Recently made a strategic move urging supporters to donate to Adrienne Adams' campaign to counter Cuomo

**Brad Lander:**
- Currently serves as City Comptroller
- Previously received AOC's endorsement in his 2021 Comptroller race
- Also endorsed by the Working Families Party
- Has established progressive credentials and a prior relationship with AOC

## Strategic Considerations

Several factors complicate AOC's endorsement decision:

1. **Timing issues:** Recent reporting from Crain's New York Business suggests that both AOC and the New York Times "may have squandered their chances to influence the mayoral primary". This timing factor increases the probability that AOC may choose not to make an endorsement at all.

2. **Split progressive field:** With multiple progressive candidates in contention and no clear consolidation, an endorsement risks dividing rather than unifying the anti-Cuomo vote.

3. **Ranked-choice voting dynamics:** The ranked-choice system complicates endorsement strategy, as voters can support multiple candidates in order of preference.

4. **Strategic progressive positioning:** Recent developments, such as Mamdani encouraging supporters to donate to Adrienne Adams, suggest ongoing strategic realignments among progressives to defeat Cuomo.

## Potential Scenarios

**Status quo outcome:** If nothing changes, AOC would make no endorsement before the primary. Given the divided field and late stage of the race, this remains a strong possibility.

**Progressive consolidation scenario:** If one progressive candidate clearly emerges as the main challenger to Cuomo, or if progressive organizations begin coalescing behind a single candidate, this could create momentum for AOC to make a decisive endorsement.

**Strategic alliance scenario:** An unexpected development could be AOC endorsing Adrienne Adams following Mamdani's recent strategic pivot to support Adams as a means to defeat Cuomo.

## Historical Precedent

AOC has sometimes waited until late in campaigns to make endorsements, and in some cases has chosen not to endorse at all when the progressive vote is divided. In the 2021 mayoral race, she endorsed Maya Wiley, who ultimately finished third.

The current situation, with multiple progressive candidates in the race and no clear frontrunner among them, resembles scenarios where she has been cautious about making endorsements, especially when her impact might be diminished.

As the primary approaches, AOC faces a strategic calculation: endorse one of the progressive candidates who may have limited chances of winning, or withhold endorsement if she believes it would have minimal impact at this stage of the race.
