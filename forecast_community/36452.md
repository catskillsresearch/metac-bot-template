(a) **Time Remaining Until the Outcome Is Known**

There are just under 8 months left until January 1, 2026—the deadline by which meaningful legislative action would need to occur to change the scheduled phase-out of the 45V tax credit before the resolution criteria are met.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes**

If no new legislation is enacted before January 1, 2026, the scheduled phase-out date for the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit remains unchanged. The credit will continue under current law, which ties its sunset to U.S. greenhouse gas emission reductions rather than a fixed calendar date, meaning the outcome will be “No sunset reduction before 2026”[1][2][4][5].

(c) **Scenario Leading to an Unexpected Outcome**

A plausible scenario for an unexpected outcome would be a dramatic fiscal development—such as a sudden, urgent revenue shortfall—prompting Congress and the Trump administration to expedite a budget package that includes a full repeal or accelerated sunset of the 45V credit. This could be justified as a cost-saving measure, particularly if coupled with broader cuts to clean energy incentives. If such a package were rushed through with limited time for industry lobbying or compromise, there may not be a safe harbor included, resulting in “2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor.” Alternatively, strong lobbying from hydrogen industry and bipartisan interest in ongoing projects could secure a safe harbor, changing the outcome to “2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor.”

## Rationale for Probabilities

- The status quo outcome is *always* the most likely unless there is clear evidence of imminent legislative change. As of early May 2025, there has not yet been any enacted legislation reducing the scheduled sunset of 45V or repealing it[2][3][4][5].
- Congressional and administrative discussions about repeal or sunset acceleration are ongoing, especially with new fiscal priorities and energy policy shifts under the Trump administration. However, major legislation is difficult and time-consuming to enact, particularly in a divided or narrowly controlled Congress[2][4].
- Historically, energy tax credits with industry and bipartisan support can survive longer than their critics anticipate, and there are still active hydrogen projects and substantial lobbying to preserve some form of credit or at least secure a safe harbor for ongoing investments[3][4].
- The Congressional Review Act could overturn recent *regulations* but cannot by itself change the statutory sunset of the tax credit, meaning such action would not satisfy the resolution criteria[5].
- The risk of repeal or sunset acceleration is real, especially as fiscal year 2026 budget negotiations intensify in late 2025, but swift action is typically rare without substantial bipartisan consensus, especially if significant investments and jobs are at stake.

## Final Probabilities

Option | Probability (%)
--- | ---
2025-2026 sunset w/o safe harbor | 10
2025-2026 sunset w/ safe harbor | 6
2027-2028 sunset w/o safe harbor | 1
2027-2028 sunset w/ safe harbor | 1
2029-2031 sunset w/o safe harbor | 1
2029-2031 sunset w/ safe harbor | 1
No sunset reduction before 2026 | 80

**Summary:**  
The most probable scenario is that no legislative action reducing the 45V sunset will be enacted before January 1, 2026 (“No sunset reduction before 2026”). However, given political volatility and fiscal pressures, there remains a meaningful—though minor—chance of repeal or acceleration, most likely in the form of a sudden 2025–2026 sunset, potentially without a safe harbor, if fiscal hawks prevail and industry resistance cannot secure protections for ongoing projects.
