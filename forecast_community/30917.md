## Rationale for the Probability of a New War or Substantial Escalation Causing 5,000+ Deaths in 2025

Global armed conflict is at one of its highest sustained levels in recent decades, with annual death tolls exceeding 200,000 since 2021 and surging even higher in certain years. This grim backdrop is shaped mainly by ongoing, high-intensity wars such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza, Sudan, and Myanmar. However, these major conflicts do not qualify under the current question’s criteria, as each has already exceeded 1,000 annual deaths in previous years and therefore cannot be considered “new wars” or “substantial escalations” by the strict definition used here.

Looking specifically at 2025, the threshold for interest is a new conflict or a drastic intensification of a previously low-fatality (<1,000 deaths in both 2023 and 2024) conflict that results in at least 5,000 deaths within the calendar year. As of late May 2025, there are no credible reports of any conflict meeting these criteria. Major ongoing wars continue to drive the bulk of global violence, but none fit the required escalation pattern. Regional violence in areas such as the Sahel, Nigeria, Niger, Myanmar, and the Horn of Africa remains significant but does not, to current knowledge, represent a sudden leap from sub-1,000 to 5,000+ annual deaths.

The most concerning new development in 2025 is the sudden escalation between India and Pakistan. Triggered by a major terrorist attack in Kashmir in April, this crisis has resulted in military confrontations, dozens of reported deaths, significant displacement, and international alarm due to the nuclear capabilities of both states. Despite the seriousness of the situation, current fatality counts (as of May 2025) remain in the low dozens, far from the 5,000-death threshold. Escalation to such a catastrophic level would require a dramatic and sustained uptick in violence—an outcome that, while not impossible given the volatility, remains historically rare due to both nuclear deterrence and the significant international attention aimed at containing such crises.

Several structural factors weigh against the likelihood of a qualifying event. New or abruptly escalating wars rarely surge past 5,000 deaths within a single year, even amidst periods of widespread global instability. In most cases, existing trends of violence persist, but transitions from latent to high-fatality conflict in a single year are the exception rather than the rule. Status quo bias and the effectiveness of international interventions further reduce the probability of such abrupt, large-scale escalations. 

Nonetheless, the probability is not negligible. The global environment in 2025 is more volatile than in the previous decade, with state fragility, unresolved regional disputes, and failures in international governance contributing to heightened risk. The possibility of an unforeseen “black swan” event—a coup, collapse of a peace process, or intervention in a previously quiet region—cannot be dismissed outright, particularly as reporting lags and incomplete data from remote areas could obscure the early stages of a rapidly escalating conflict.

In summary, despite the elevated baseline of global violence and the presence of credible risks—most notably in South Asia—the historical rarity of qualifying escalations and the absence of current evidence for such an event make a new war or substantial escalation causing at least 5,000 deaths in 2025 a significant but not predominant risk. The scenario remains plausible but is outweighed by the tendency for conflicts to either persist at current levels or be contained before reaching catastrophic thresholds.
