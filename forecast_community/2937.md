(a) Time left until outcome known: 232 days (May 13, 2025 to December 31, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Current CDC estimates show approximately 35,000-37,000 annual deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections in the US.

(c) No scenario: Antimicrobial resistance continues its gradual increase, but not at a pace that would double US deaths by the end of 2025. Improved stewardship programs, infection control measures, and diagnostic testing help moderate the growth rate.

(d) Yes scenario: A dramatic acceleration in antimicrobial resistance occurs in the US, possibly due to a new highly virulent resistant strain, significant breakdown in infection control protocols, or major disruption to the antibiotic supply chain, causing deaths to spike rapidly to 70,000+ annually.

Based on the available information, I assess that the number of deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections in the US is unlikely to double by December 31, 2025. Here's my rationale:

## Historical Trends and Growth Rate

The global burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is certainly growing, but the rate of increase doesn't support a doubling of US deaths in the next 7 months. According to GRAM Project forecasts published in The Lancet, global deaths directly attributed to bacterial AMR are expected to increase from 1.14 million in 2021 to 1.91 million by 2050[1]. This represents an approximately 67.5% increase over a 29-year period, equating to roughly a 2% annual growth rate.

This gradual upward trajectory doesn't align with the dramatic acceleration that would be needed for US deaths to double from approximately 35,000-37,000 to 70,000+ by the end of 2025[2].

## Recent US-Specific Data

None of the provided search results indicate a recent surge in US antimicrobial resistance deaths that would suggest we're on track for a doubling by year-end 2025. While there is concerning news about specific resistant pathogens like Candida auris (with 1,052 cases reported in 2025), this alone doesn't indicate a nationwide doubling of overall AMR deaths.

## Global vs. US Patterns

While global forecasts predict a cumulative 39 million deaths directly attributable to bacterial AMR between 2025 and 2050[3], this translates to approximately 1.56 million deaths annually worldwide. The US historically accounts for a small fraction of this global burden, making it implausible that US deaths would suddenly represent a substantially larger proportion without unprecedented circumstances.

## Age-Related Trends

The search results indicate that AMR deaths among children under five are projected to decline by 50% by 2050 globally, while deaths among people 70 years and older are expected to more than double[1]. This demographic shift doesn't support an overall doubling of US deaths in the short term, especially given the US age distribution.

## Potential Mitigating Factors

Several initiatives could help prevent a dramatic spike in deaths:
- Improved diagnostic testing, which experts at the Criticare Convention 2025 emphasized as key to preventing antibiotic resistance
- Development of alternatives like bacteriophage therapy
- Enhanced antimicrobial stewardship programs
- Better infection prevention and control measures

While antimicrobial resistance remains a serious public health threat with a concerning upward trajectory, the evidence suggests that a doubling of US deaths by December 31, 2025 would require an unprecedented acceleration that isn't supported by current trends or forecasts. The most likely scenario is a continued gradual increase rather than a dramatic spike.
