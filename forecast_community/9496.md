France’s electricity mix in 2035 will be shaped by a reenergized commitment to nuclear power, anchored by recent policy shifts, institutional momentum, and the evolving electricity demand landscape. The formal objective to reduce nuclear’s share to 50% by 2035 has been abandoned, with policy now supporting a minimum nuclear share above 50% through 2050. This adjustment reflects both energy security considerations and France’s broader decarbonization aims.

Nuclear power currently provides around 60–67% of France’s electricity, making it the dominant source. As of 2024, renewable sources—primarily hydropower, wind, and solar—supply roughly one-third of total consumption, and this share is expected to rise, driven by government targets and ambitious capacity expansion plans. However, expert analyses and official forecasts suggest that, even as renewables expand significantly, nuclear power will remain the backbone of the system.

Projections from the French energy regulator (CRE) indicate stable nuclear output, assuming life extensions of the existing fleet to 60 years and a moderate increase in nuclear capacity, from 61 GW in 2024 to 63 GW by 2035. CRE forecasts nuclear generation at around 360.2 TWh annually for 2031–2035, reflecting stable to slightly growing output despite the rise in renewables. Planned new reactors (such as EPR2 units) will likely not enter service until after 2035, so their impact within this timeframe will be minimal.

France’s updated Multi-Year Energy Program (PPE) and government statements emphasize dual pillars: robust nuclear power and expanded renewables. The approach aims to balance decarbonization with energy security and sovereignty, particularly as demand may rise due to electrification and emerging sectors, including AI and data centers. The potential for electricity demand to overshoot forecasts is a significant factor that could favor a higher nuclear share if renewables scale more slowly than planned.

Nevertheless, there are uncertainties. Scenarios leading to a lower nuclear share include accelerated retirements of aging reactors due to technical or safety issues, faster-than-expected renewable deployment (possibly enabled by breakthroughs in storage), or disruptive policy changes after future elections. Conversely, scenarios for a higher nuclear share involve lagging renewable roll-out, elevated electricity demand, timely or extended operation of the existing reactor fleet, and any significant delays in scaling renewables.

Overall, France’s policy direction, expert projections, and infrastructure investments indicate that nuclear will supply a majority—likely between just over 50% and up to around 65%—of its electricity in 2035, with renewables accounting for most of the remainder. The energy strategy is designed for flexibility, prioritizing system resilience and low-carbon generation while accommodating uncertainties in both demand and technology development.
