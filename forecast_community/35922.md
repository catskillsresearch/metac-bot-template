(a) **Time left until resolution**:  
The outcome will be known by January 1, 2026. As of May 13, 2025, about 7.5 months remain.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes**:  
Under current law and IRS guidance as of May 2025, the domestic content requirements for the Inflation Reduction Act’s Production Tax Credit (45Y) are **not mandatory**. They are an optional path to receive an additional 10% bonus credit, not a prerequisite for the base credit[2][3][5].

(c) **Scenario resulting in a No outcome**:  
Congress does not enact any legislation before January 1, 2026, to make domestic content requirements mandatory for the 45Y PTC. The requirements remain as an optional bonus. The IRS and Treasury continue issuing guidance focused on safe harbors and definitions for the bonus, but there is no statutory or regulatory shift to a mandate[2][3][5].

(d) **Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome**:  
A federal bill is enacted before January 1, 2026, changing the law so that projects must meet domestic content requirements (at least as strict as current bonus requirements) to qualify for any 45Y Production Tax Credit, not just the bonus. This would require overcoming political, legislative, and stakeholder resistance, and clear text in the enacted law establishing the mandate.

## Rationale

All recent IRS and Treasury guidance continues to reflect the existing structure: domestic content requirements are **optional** for the bonus credit but not required for the base PTC (45Y)[2][3][5]. The latest IRS Notice (2025-08) issued in January 2025 confirms this structure and only updates how compliance can be calculated—not the fundamental policy design[3][5]. No regulatory change has been proposed or finalized to make these requirements mandatory for claiming the standard credit[2][3][5].

On the legislative front, while the new Republican congressional majority and the Trump administration are actively working on a budget reconciliation bill that could reduce or repeal some IRA provisions, available legislative text aims to phase out, scale back, or terminate clean energy credits entirely—not to tighten them by making domestic content requirements mandatory for remaining credits[Washington Examiner].

Public statements from Republican leaders indicate a targeted approach: Speaker Mike Johnson described it as "somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer," while a House Republican bloc supports a "thoughtful phaseout," not the addition of new mandates[Washington Examiner]. There is no evidence of any proposal being advanced to transform the domestic content bonus into a baseline requirement[2][3].

Historically, major changes to tax policy in reconciliation bills have been difficult to enact, especially with narrow majorities. There is no precedent for such a significant policy reversal—transforming a voluntary bonus into a statutory mandate—given the current political and industry landscape[1][2].

While some advocacy and commentary suggest that stricter domestic content rules could be considered in the future, there is no legislative movement or regulatory process underway to require domestic content for the base 45Y credit before January 1, 2026[2][3][5].

## Final Assessment

Given the clear status quo, the absence of any active movement toward making domestic content requirements mandatory for the 45Y Production Tax Credit, and the political focus on repeal or phaseout rather than expansion of mandates, the probability such a requirement becomes mandatory before January 1, 2026, remains very low.

**Probability: 5%**
