The outcome of solar energy's share in the United States' primary energy mix by 2031 is influenced by several key factors. As of 2019, solar energy accounted for 1.02% of primary energy generation. If no changes occur, this percentage would remain static. However, historical data from 2009 to 2019 shows a significant growth trend, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 65%. While this rate is unlikely to continue due to market saturation and a larger base, a more modest growth trajectory could see solar energy's share reaching between 5% and 8% by 2031.

Experts and market analysts project a range of 4% to 10% by 2031, factoring in technological advancements, policy changes, and grid integration challenges. The potential for growth is supported by ongoing improvements in solar technology and energy storage, as well as policy initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy sources.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A low outcome might result from significant policy rollbacks, technological stagnation, or severe grid integration issues, potentially limiting solar energy's share to around 2% to 3%. Conversely, a high outcome could be driven by breakthroughs in energy storage technology, aggressive policy support, and the rapid retirement of fossil fuel plants, potentially increasing solar energy's share to 12% or more.

Overall, the future share of solar energy in the U.S. primary energy mix will depend on a complex interplay of technological, policy, and market factors, with both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios possible.
