(a) **Time until resolution:**  
There are approximately 7.5 months remaining until January 1, 2026, when the outcome to the question will be known.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes:**  
There is no credible evidence or official indication that Ukraine has launched a nuclear weapons program as of May 2025. All recent official statements reaffirm Ukraine’s commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and deny any current plans to develop nuclear arms[2][5]. No credible reports from Ukrainian officials, allied governments, international agencies, or major media have stated otherwise.

(c) **Scenario for a "No" outcome:**  
Ukraine continues its current policy, maintaining strong rhetoric about nuclear options as leverage but stopping short of actual program initiation. Western military and economic support, though sometimes tenuous, remains sufficient to deter Ukraine from pursuing nuclear arms. The IAEA maintains oversight of Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure, and no credible reports of a weapons program emerge by January 1, 2026.

(d) **Scenario for a "Yes" outcome:**  
A dramatic shift occurs—such as a collapse in Western support, a decisive escalation of Russian aggression, or credible and public evidence that Ukraine has officially launched or intends to launch a nuclear weapons program. This could take the form of an official announcement by Ukrainian leadership, major leaks reported by international media, or confirmation by an international agency (e.g., the IAEA) of clandestine weapons-related activity. The scenario might also entail Ukraine taking operational control of nuclear warheads supplied by another state, provided Ukraine holds command authority.

## Rationale

- **Technical Feasibility:** Ukraine possesses the technical know-how, nuclear materials, and missile technology to begin a weapons program should the political decision be made[2][5].
- **Political and Diplomatic Barriers:** Every authoritative statement by Ukrainian government ministers and the president has clarified that, despite occasional rhetorical hints, there are no current plans to develop nuclear weapons. Ukraine has repeatedly committed to the NPT, emphasizing diplomatic solutions[2][5].
- **International Oversight:** Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are heavily monitored by the IAEA, making any covert nuclear program exceedingly difficult to hide[3].
- **Deterrence via Rhetoric:** Ukrainian leaders have used the nuclear issue mainly as a diplomatic tool to pressure Western allies for more substantial security guarantees[2], not as an actionable policy.
- **Geopolitical Incentives:** Initiating a nuclear weapons program would risk the loss of remaining Western support and trigger international sanctions or worse. Unless absolutely necessary for national survival, such a move is highly unlikely.
- **Indicators to Watch:** The most plausible trigger for a shift would be a total collapse of Western support or a final, catastrophic breakdown in Ukraine’s security environment, but there is no sign of this as of May 2025.

Given the current evidence, the world is in a slow-changing, "status quo" regime. Absent a major and disruptive shock, Ukraine will not launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026.
