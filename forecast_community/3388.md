With approximately 3 years and 6 months remaining until 2028, the current status quo indicates that 2% of U.S. adults self-report as dietary vegans, based on the 2019 VRG survey. If the current trend of slow but steady increase in vegan self-identification continues, the percentage might rise to around 2.5% to 3% by 2028. Experts and market forecasts align with this expectation, suggesting a modest increase to a range of 2% to 3.5%, influenced by generational shifts and the growing visibility of plant-based diets.

However, unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A potential backlash against veganism, possibly fueled by negative media coverage or a major health study discrediting vegan diets, could result in a decrease in self-reported veganism, potentially dropping below 2%. Conversely, a major health or environmental campaign, supported by influential public figures and backed by scientific evidence, could lead to a surge in vegan self-identification, potentially reaching 4% or higher. Additionally, a significant cultural shift driven by influential figures or a notable health or environmental event could further accelerate this increase, potentially pushing the rate to 5% or more.
