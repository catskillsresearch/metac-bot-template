The geopolitical and institutional landscape currently presents significant barriers to Israel joining the EU before 2050. Israel is not geographically part of Europe and is not considered a candidate for EU membership. The EU's enlargement policies have historically focused on European countries, and there is no precedent for admitting a non-European country. Additionally, ongoing regional conflicts, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and human rights issues further complicate Israel's potential candidacy. The EU prioritizes regional stability, human rights, and adherence to international law in its foreign policy, maintaining a stance of close cooperation with Israel without offering full membership.

For Israel to join the EU, a dramatic geopolitical shift would be necessary. This would involve a comprehensive resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, significant improvements in Israel's human rights record, and a revision of the EU's enlargement criteria to include non-European countries. Such changes would also require Israel's strategic importance to the EU to increase significantly, prompting a reconsideration of its membership status. However, these shifts are unpredictable and would require substantial changes in both EU policies and regional dynamics.

Given the current trajectory and the slow pace of change in international relations, the probability of Israel joining the EU before 2050 remains low. The status quo strongly favors a "No" outcome, as the existing geopolitical and institutional context does not support Israel's accession to the EU.
