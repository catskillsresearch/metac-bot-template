(a) **Time Left Until Outcome:**  
There are approximately 6.5 weeks (about 48 days) until July 1, 2025, the deadline for determining whether Mahmoud Khalil is deported.

(b) **Status Quo Outcome if Nothing Changed:**  
Currently, Mahmoud Khalil remains in ICE detention in Louisiana. Although an immigration judge has ruled he is deportable and his permanent resident status has been revoked, a federal judge has put a stay on his deportation while his legal challenges—including constitutional claims of due process and free speech violations—proceed in federal court. As of now, Khalil cannot be deported until the courts resolve his pending cases[1][3][4]. If nothing changes, the status quo outcome is **No**—he will not be deported before July 1, 2025.

(c) **Scenario Resulting in a No Outcome:**  
Khalil’s legal team successfully maintains the court-ordered stay on deportation through July 1, 2025. Federal courts continue reviewing his constitutional challenge, and no further removal action is taken until the case is fully adjudicated. Delays, appeals, and possible injunctions keep Khalil in the U.S. past July 1[1][3][4].

(d) **Scenario Resulting in a Yes Outcome:**  
The federal court lifts the stay or rules against Khalil on urgent motions (such as bail or preliminary injunction), and the government moves swiftly to execute the deportation order. Political or administrative pressure leads to expedited removal proceedings, and Khalil is forcibly transported out of the United States before July 1, 2025. This would require a rapid and decisive turn in the legal process in the government's favor[4].

## **Rationale**

- **Status quo inertia:**  
Court-ordered stays in high-profile, constitutionally complex deportation cases like this one often persist for months or years, especially with ongoing federal litigation and appeals. The fact that Khalil's legal team is backed by prominent organizations (ACLU, Center for Constitutional Rights, etc.) increases the likelihood of prolonged proceedings and robust defense[1][3].
- **Judicial precedent:**  
Other international students in similar high-profile cases (Rümeysa Öztürk, Moshen Mahdawi) were ultimately released or saw proceedings drag on due to lack of evidence or successful legal challenges, further supporting the expectation that stays will remain in place while court reviews continue[3].
- **Political and Public Pressure:**  
There is significant advocacy and media attention, with human rights organizations and student groups mobilizing against Khalil's deportation. This often encourages courts to proceed cautiously and avoid rushed removal, especially with constitutional claims at stake[2][3].
- **Legal process realities:**  
Federal court review cycles and appeals typically extend longer than 6–7 weeks unless there is a clear and urgent ruling. No reporting or official indication suggests imminent deportation action or dissolution of the stay[1][4].

### **Downside Risks / Uncertainties**
- **Change in judicial posture:**  
If the federal court is persuaded by government arguments or is pressured politically to expedite, a rapid ruling against Khalil could result in the lifting of the stay and execution of the deportation order before July 1. This is plausible but less likely, given norms in federal habeas and constitutional review cases.
- **Executive action:**  
A major, unforeseeable policy escalation by the administration or intervention at the highest levels could potentially bypass or override judicial delays, but this would be highly unusual and would likely generate further legal challenges.

## **Final Forecast**

Based on the status quo with ongoing federal court review, an active deportation stay, and the slow pace of constitutional litigation—countered by some risk of expedited government action under intense political pressure—the most likely outcome is that Mahmoud Khalil **will not** be deported before July 1, 2025.

**Probability: 85%**
