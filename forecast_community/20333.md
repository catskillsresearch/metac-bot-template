Looking at the question about a new SARS-CoV-2 variant causing at least 20,000 daily COVID hospitalizations in the US before July 1, 2025, I'll analyze this carefully.

(a) Time left until outcome: Approximately 7 weeks (from May 12, 2025 to July 1, 2025)

(b) Status quo outcome: Based on current data, COVID-19 hospitalizations are at relatively low levels. The CovidHub ensemble forecasts approximately 3,900 weekly (not daily) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions nationally for the week ending May 17, 2025, down from 4,400 admissions for the week ending May 3, 2025[2]. This translates to roughly 557-629 daily hospitalizations, far below the 20,000 threshold.

(c) No outcome scenario: COVID-19 variants continue to circulate but none are classified as a VOC before July 1. Hospitalizations remain at current levels or follow typical seasonal patterns with modest increases. Population immunity from vaccination and prior infection remains sufficient to prevent severe disease in most people. No variant emerges with significant immune escape or increased severity properties.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: A highly transmissible new variant with substantial immune escape emerges and is quickly classified as a VOC. This variant spreads rapidly across the US, causing a steep surge in hospitalizations that overwhelms the typical seasonal patterns. The variant causes more severe disease or affects previously protected populations, leading to daily hospitalizations exceeding 20,000 before July 1.

Looking at the current data, the CovidHub ensemble forecast predicts weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 3,900 nationally for the week ending May 17, 2025[2]. This represents a decrease from the 4,400 admissions reported for the week ending May 3, 2025. The forecast range spans from 2,000 to 6,200 admissions, showing considerable uncertainty but still far below the threshold needed for a "Yes" outcome[2].

Historical data provides important context. During the 2024-2025 season, as of January 29, 2025, the overall rate of COVID-19-related hospitalizations was 38.0 per 100,000 people[4]. Among hospitalized patients, 18.4% required ICU care, 8.4% needed mechanical ventilation, and 6.9% died while hospitalized[4]. These figures reflect the continued severity of COVID-19 among those who develop serious illness but don't suggest we're on a trajectory toward 20,000 daily hospitalizations.

Several factors make a "Yes" outcome unlikely in the short timeframe remaining:

1. No current indication of an emerging VOC in the search results
2. Current hospitalization trends are stable or declining
3. The substantial gap between current levels (hundreds of daily hospitalizations) and the threshold (20,000)
4. The short timeframe (7 weeks) provides limited opportunity for a new variant to emerge, be classified as a VOC, spread widely, and cause such a dramatic hospitalization surge

While COVID-19 has demonstrated the ability to produce surprise variants with increased transmissibility and immune evasion, the magnitude and speed of change required to reach 20,000 daily hospitalizations by July 1 would be unprecedented given the current baseline. The status quo strongly suggests hospitalizations will remain well below this threshold.

Probability: 5%
