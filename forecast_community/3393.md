The current situation regarding the potential DNA testing to confirm Jeanne Calment's identity as the oldest recorded person in history is complex and fraught with challenges. The status quo heavily leans towards an ambiguous outcome, primarily because no DNA testing has been conducted or announced to date. The scientific community has expressed interest in resolving this controversy, but significant legal, logistical, and bureaucratic hurdles remain. These obstacles, coupled with potential issues of national pride, may impede the progress towards conducting such tests.

Despite these challenges, the probability of DNA testing occurring is not negligible. The preserved blood samples and the scientific interest in this case provide a foundation for potential testing. If DNA testing were to occur, the evidence supporting Jeanne Calment's identity is considered stronger than the circumstantial evidence suggesting an identity switch. The professional community of demographers largely supports the validation of Jeanne Calment's age, and the official validation process has been thorough, supported by multiple lines of evidence.

However, the possibility of an identity switch, while not widely accepted, cannot be entirely dismissed. It relies on circumstantial evidence and probabilities, which have not convinced the majority of experts. Given the current evidence and the slow pace of change in such matters, the likelihood of DNA testing vindicating Jeanne Calment is higher than the likelihood of disproving her identity. Nonetheless, the potential for no resolution remains significant due to the existing barriers to conducting the tests.
