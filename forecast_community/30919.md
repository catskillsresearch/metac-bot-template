Argentina's poverty rate has shown significant improvement since its peak in early 2024. The most recent official data from INDEC reveals that poverty dropped to 38.1% in the second half of 2024, down from 52.9% in the first half of 2024 and 41.7% in the second half of 2023. This dramatic decrease of 14.8 percentage points in just six months represents a substantial buffer below the 41.7% benchmark we're evaluating against.

## Economic Context and Drivers

Several key economic factors support continued poverty reduction in early 2025:

1. **Economic Growth**: GDP growth projections for 2025 are robust, with estimates ranging between 4.8% and 5.5%. This level of growth typically supports poverty reduction through job creation and increased economic activity.

2. **Inflation Trajectory**: While still high by global standards, inflation has decreased substantially from approximately 300% in early 2024 to 47.3% in April 2025. This continued disinflation helps preserve purchasing power, particularly for lower-income households.

3. **Fiscal Performance**: The government has maintained a fiscal surplus through much of 2024, with projections for a positive balance of +0.9% of GDP for 2025. This macroeconomic stabilization contributes to economic confidence.

4. **Employment Trends**: Reports indicate positive employment trends, with some suggesting record-high employment rates in certain sectors. This is crucial for poverty reduction as increased employment directly affects household incomes.

## Risk Factors

Despite the positive trajectory, several risks could impact poverty reduction:

1. **Salary Constraints**: The government's "salary anchor" policy limits wage growth negotiations, potentially constraining real income recovery and consumption growth for lower and middle-income groups.

2. **Rising Basic Basket Costs**: The Total Basic Shopping-Basket that determines the poverty line increased to 356,073 USD in March 2025, up from 342,370 USD previously. Continued increases could push more people below the poverty threshold.

3. **Fiscal Adjustment Impact**: Some economists, including Cristian MÃ³dolo, warn that 2025 will be "a very difficult year for economic activity" due to the government's continued focus on controlling inflation through fiscal tightening.

4. **Social Program Adjustments**: There are indications that the government may be reducing some social support programs in 2025 that had been maintained in 2024, such as the Food Card. This could affect the most vulnerable populations.

## Measurement Considerations

The World Bank projects Argentina's poverty rate will decline to 12.7% by 2025, though this uses a different methodology than INDEC's official measure. Private estimates suggest the rate could be as low as 30-33% during 2025, while President Milei has claimed rates around 33-36% already.

## Probability Assessment

For the poverty rate to exceed 41.7% in the first half of 2025, there would need to be a reversal of at least 3.6 percentage points from the current 38.1% level in just six months. Given the continuing economic growth and disinflation, such a dramatic reversal seems unlikely without a major economic shock or policy reversal.

Large, rapid increases in poverty are historically rare absent severe economic shocks. The most probable outcome is that poverty rates in the first half of 2025 will remain similar to or marginally better than the second half of 2024, continuing below the 41.7% threshold from the second half of 2023.

While economic vulnerabilities remain and the recovery appears uneven across sectors and regions, the preponderance of evidence suggests Argentina's poverty rate will remain below the 41.7% benchmark in the first half of 2025.
