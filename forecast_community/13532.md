As a professional forecaster interviewing for a job, I need to analyze the question about Sam Bankman-Fried's prison sentence before 2026. Based on the available information, I'll provide a comprehensive forecast analysis.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome is already known. According to the search results, Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years (300 months) in prison on March 28, 2024[1]. Today is May 12, 2025, so this sentencing occurred over a year ago.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
The current outcome is 300 months (25 years), as SBF was sentenced to this prison term on March 28, 2024[1].

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
There is no trend to continue as the sentencing has already occurred. Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving his 25-year sentence, and as of April 10, 2025, he was transferred to a "notoriously hard" prison in California[2].

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
There are no specific expert opinions or market predictions in the search results regarding changes to SBF's sentence. The sentence appears to be final at 25 years (300 months), with no indication of pending appeals that might succeed in reducing it.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A successful appeal could potentially reduce SBF's sentence. If his legal team identified procedural errors or constitutional issues with the trial or sentencing, a higher court might overturn or reduce the sentence. However, there's no indication in the search results that such an appeal is in progress or likely to succeed.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
Additional charges or evidence of further criminal activity while in custody could potentially lead to additional sentences. If SBF were found to have committed other financial crimes that weren't part of the original case, or if he committed new offenses while in prison, his total sentence could increase. However, there's no indication in the search results that additional charges are being considered.

Given that the sentence has already been determined and there is no information suggesting it will change, my confidence intervals are very narrow around the known outcome of 300 months. However, as a good forecaster, I should account for the small possibility of successful appeals or additional sentences.
