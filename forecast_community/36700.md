(a) Time left until outcome: about 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025)
(b) Status quo outcome: Ceasefire holds, death toll remains below 100
(c) No scenario: Diplomatic efforts led by the US successfully maintain the May 10 ceasefire, preventing further escalation and keeping the combined death toll below 100
(d) Yes scenario: Ceasefire breaks down, fighting resumes and intensifies, leading to additional military and civilian casualties that push the total above 100 deaths

Based on the evidence available, I can provide a comprehensive forecast on whether the India-Pakistan conflict will result in 100 deaths in May or June 2025.

The recent conflict between India and Pakistan has been the most severe escalation between these nuclear-armed neighbors in decades. The situation began with a terrorist attack on April 22, 2025, in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians[5]. This attack triggered a series of diplomatic and military actions culminating in armed conflict in early May.

## Current Status of the Conflict

As of May 13, 2025, a ceasefire between India and Pakistan has been in effect since May 10[5]. This ceasefire was brokered through international mediation, particularly by the United States under former President Donald Trump[1]. However, there have been reports of violations shortly after the agreement was reached, indicating its fragility[1][5].

The reported casualties from the conflict so far vary by source and are contested by both sides:

- Pakistan has reported 33 people killed and 76 injured within its territory[5]
- India has confirmed the loss of 5 personnel, with claims that Pakistan lost 35-40 personnel[1]
- Indian Defense Minister claimed at least 100 terrorists were killed in missile strikes[1]
- Some sources report about 48 deaths and over 100 injuries since May 7[5]

## Key Factors Affecting the Forecast

### Historical Precedent

Previous conflicts between India and Pakistan have typically stopped short of causing mass casualties, with international mediation often preventing further escalation. The 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis, for instance, resulted in significantly fewer than 100 deaths.

### Current Diplomatic Efforts

The current ceasefire, while fragile, represents a significant de-escalation effort. Both countries have agreed to hold talks, scheduled for May 12 (yesterday)[5]. The involvement of the US, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey in facilitating negotiations suggests substantial international pressure to maintain peace[5].

### Military Mobilization

Both countries have mobilized significant military assets. India has reportedly mobilized 50,000 reserve troops and activated additional battalions[5]. Pakistan has moved tanks and troops to its border near Lahore[5]. This high level of military readiness increases the risk of rapid escalation if the ceasefire breaks down.

### Public Sentiment

There appears to be significant nationalist sentiment in both countries, with social media activity showing support for military action[5]. This public pressure could make it politically difficult for leaders to maintain restraint if provocations occur.

## Probability Assessment

Given the evidence, I assess that there is a significant but not overwhelming probability that the conflict will result in at least 100 deaths in May or June 2025.

Factors supporting a higher probability:
- The conflict has already resulted in dozens of deaths in just a few days of active fighting
- Multiple reports of ceasefire violations suggest instability
- Both sides have mobilized substantial military forces
- Historical animosity and the Kashmir dispute remain unresolved
- Public sentiment in both countries appears to favor strong action

Factors supporting a lower probability:
- The ceasefire has been in place for three days as of May 13
- International mediation is actively working to prevent escalation
- Both countries are aware of the catastrophic potential of full-scale war
- Previous conflicts between these nations have typically been contained
- The most intense period of fighting may have already passed

Given that approximately 50-70 deaths have already occurred according to various sources, and considering the fragility of the current ceasefire, the threshold of 100 deaths could be reached if fighting resumes even briefly. However, if the ceasefire holds, which appears to be the current trend despite some violations, the death toll may remain below 100.

Considering the status quo tendency in international relations and the strong incentives both nuclear-armed nations have to avoid major conflict, I believe the ceasefire is more likely to hold than fail completely, though limited violations may continue to occur.

Probability: 45%
