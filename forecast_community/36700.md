# India-Pakistan Conflict Death Toll Assessment (May-June 2025)

The recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan represents the most severe escalation between these nuclear-armed neighbors in decades. Following a terrorist attack on April 22, 2025, in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians, tensions rapidly escalated into open military conflict beginning on May 7, 2025.

## Timeline and Scale of the Conflict

The conflict began when India launched "Operation Sindoor" on May 7, targeting what they described as "terrorist infrastructure" across nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This operation involved missile strikes, airstrikes, and artillery fire, marking India's deepest incursion into Pakistani territory since the 1971 war. Pakistan responded with "Operation Bunyān Mārsūs," launching counter-strikes against Indian military installations.

The fighting continued for approximately four days before a ceasefire was announced on May 10, 2025, effective at 5:00 pm IST. The conflict featured:

- Extensive use of drones (with reports of Pakistan deploying 300-400 drones against India)
- Missile strikes on both sides
- Artillery exchanges along the Line of Control
- Airstrikes resulting in the downing of multiple aircraft

## Reported Casualties

Multiple sources provide casualty figures, though with some variations:

- Pakistan reported 33 deaths and 76 injuries on their side
- India acknowledged 26 deaths (21 civilians and 5 military personnel) on their side
- Other sources indicate higher numbers: 26 civilian casualties and 46 injured in Pakistan according to one report
- One source cited "dozens" of deaths, while another mentioned approximately 48 deaths and over 100 injuries since May 7
- One report claimed "over 100 militants" were killed during India's Operation Sindoor

When combining the casualties from both sides across multiple reports, it appears likely that the total death toll exceeds 100. Even taking the most conservative estimates (26 Pakistani deaths + 26 Indian deaths), the casualties approach or exceed 50. When accounting for additional reported militant casualties, the threshold of 100 deaths is likely surpassed.

## Current Status and Ceasefire Stability

As of May 26, 2025, the ceasefire established on May 10 appears to be generally holding, though both sides have accused each other of violations. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, along with other Indian observers, reported loud explosions and firing a few hours after the ceasefire had been finalized. Drones were also reportedly seen in the skies over Srinagar and Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.

Both countries have implemented various retaliatory measures that remain in place, including:
- Suspension of visa services
- Closure of airspace
- Ban on bilateral trade
- Closure of the Attari-Wagah border crossing
- Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India

International mediation, particularly by the United States, has played a significant role in maintaining the ceasefire. Talks between both countries' military personnel took place on May 12, but it remains to be seen if this paves the way for meaningful political dialogue.

## Analysis of Conflict Intensity

This was a high-intensity, albeit brief, conflict featuring modern weapons systems including S-400 air defense systems, drones, and missiles. The scale of disruption was significant, as evidenced by India closing 27 airports and canceling over 430 flights, and Pakistan suspending flights from key airports including Karachi and Lahore.

The conflict has been described as the most serious confrontation between the two countries since the 1999 Kargil War, with unprecedented use of drones and advanced missile systems by both sides.

## Outlook and Unresolved Issues

The ceasefire does not address any of the underlying grievances in the bilateral relationship. India has stated that talks can only discuss the issues of terrorism and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while Pakistan will want to focus on the resumption of the Indus Waters Treaty and the status of Indian-administered Kashmir. The last time both countries engaged in substantive peace talks was the Composite Dialogue process that came to a halt following the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008.

Given the historical pattern of underreporting casualties in conflicts between these nations, the damage reported to civilian infrastructure including schools and religious sites, and the intensity of the military operations, the actual death toll likely exceeds the officially reported figures.

Taking into account the scale of military operations, the types of weapons used, the duration of active fighting, and the casualty reports from multiple sources, it appears highly probable that the threshold of 100 deaths has already been met during the May 7-10 conflict, even without additional casualties in June.
