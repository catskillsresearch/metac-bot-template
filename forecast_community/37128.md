President Trump has consistently voiced opposition to the Diversity Visa program, both during his first administration and since returning to office in January 2025. His longstanding criticism centers on claims that the program brings in immigrants who have not been adequately vetted, posing perceived security risks to the United States. During his initial term, he attempted to restrict or eliminate the program, and this opposition continues in his current policy stance.

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has issued several executive actions focused on immigration. These have prioritized enhanced vetting of visa applicants, border security, and notable changes such as the proposed "Gold Card" program designed to overhaul investment-based green cards. However, none of these presidential actions have mentioned the Diversity Visa program by name as of the end of May 2025, despite multiple opportunities and ongoing activity on other immigration fronts.

Recent legislative developments, such as the introduction of the SAFE for America Act of 2025, aim to eliminate the Diversity Visa program through congressional channels. This legislative push signals alignment with Trump’s stated goals but also suggests a strategic preference for advancing this particular policy through Congress rather than direct executive action. The administration’s current focus appears to be on reforms prioritized as higher urgency, such as border security and investment-based migration pathways, rather than the Diversity Visa program.

Timing is an important consideration. With just over 40 days remaining until July 1, 2025, the window for President Trump to issue a new presidential action specifically mentioning the Diversity Visa program is rapidly narrowing. Executive actions of this magnitude typically require substantial planning, legal review, and interagency coordination. While the process could be expedited if the issue were prioritized, there have been no recent public signals indicating imminent executive action specific to the Diversity Visa program.

Additionally, practical factors weigh against immediate action. The 2026 Diversity Visa lottery results were released on May 3, 2025, and the program continues to function without disruption, indicating no ongoing administrative push to halt or alter its operations. The absence of any recent public statements or directives targeting the Diversity Visa specifically further reduces the likelihood of imminent presidential action.

In summary, although President Trump’s opposition to the Diversity Visa program is clear and legislative efforts to eliminate it are active, the administration has so far prioritized other immigration initiatives and has not indicated that executive action targeting the program is forthcoming. The legislative route currently being pursued may reduce the urgency or perceived need for such a presidential action within the remaining timeframe. Given these factors, the current trajectory strongly favors the status quo, making a new presidential action specifically mentioning the Diversity Visa by July 1, 2025, unlikely.
