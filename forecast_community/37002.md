## Starlink in Chad: Launch Timeline Analysis

As of May 15, 2025, Chad is not yet listed as "Available" on the Starlink Availability Map, with approximately 1.5 months remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. The current status quo points toward a "No" outcome if nothing changes, but significant developments in Chad's Starlink approval process suggest this is likely to change.

## Regulatory Progress and Timeline

Chad has made substantial regulatory progress toward Starlink availability. The country initially approved Starlink's license in November 2024 after discussions that began in 2021. Most significantly, in March 2025, Chad's Ministry of Telecommunications, Digital Economy and Digitalization announced that Starlink had officially signed its operating license. This formal signing followed what were described as "extensive discussions" to ensure compliance with national regulatory, security, and economic requirements.

The March 2025 license signing represents a critical milestone, as it removes the primary regulatory barrier to Starlink's operations in Chad. Communications Minister Boukar Michel emphasized the importance of this partnership, noting that "A large part of our territory is not covered by fibre optics, and I believe that Starlink will help us bridge this gap". This strong government support indicates a commitment to expediting the service launch.

## Historical Precedent in African Markets

Examining Starlink's expansion pattern across Africa provides valuable context for Chad's timeline:

- In Niger, Starlink moved from final regulatory approval to commercial service launch in a matter of months. The Ministry of Communications announced on March 17, 2025 that Starlink services were commercially available, with residential and corporate kits available for purchase online and from authorized sellers.

- Other African countries have seen Starlink availability within approximately 1-4 months after regulatory approval, establishing a consistent pattern for the company's rollout strategy in the region.

- The Chadian government, in collaboration with SpaceX, has announced that Starlink service would be available nationwide by the end of 2025, though this timeline extends beyond our evaluation period.

## Technical and Market Considerations

Chad represents a particularly strategic market for Starlink, with only 12% of the population having internet access as of 2022. This digital divide creates strong incentives for both Starlink and the Chadian government to expedite deployment.

Starlink's satellite technology is especially valuable for Chad's geography and infrastructure limitations. As the first satellite operator officially authorized to operate in Chad, Starlink addresses a critical need in a country where "internet access remains expensive and inefficient, hampering its economic and social development".

## Timeline Assessment

Considering all factors:

1. Approximately 2 months have passed since Chad's formal license signing in March 2025
2. The typical implementation window observed in similar African markets is 1-4 months from approval to availability
3. Chad has demonstrated strong government support for rapid deployment
4. No reports indicate specific technical or regulatory complications since the March approval

While the status quo currently shows Chad as unavailable on Starlink's website, all indicators point to an imminent change. The timeline from the March 2025 licensing to July 1 provides sufficient time for Starlink to complete implementation based on its demonstrated expansion velocity in comparable markets.

Potential risks include unforeseen operational challenges, customs delays for equipment, or additional compliance requirements. However, given that the formal regulatory process is complete and Starlink has successfully navigated similar rapid deployments across Africa, these risks appear manageable within the remaining timeframe.
