With exactly 15 days remaining until the target date, the outlook for total likes on Bluesky hinges on a balance between steady, moderate growth and the potential for more dramatic shifts. Under typical conditions where existing trends continue without interruption, many signals point to a cumulative total in the neighborhood of 625 million likes—with some considerations even nudging that modestly upward, perhaps to around 640 million likes. This moderate expectation is reinforced by expert judgment and prevailing market sentiment, which generally favor steady, incremental growth.

At the same time, there are well-recognized scenarios that could diverge from this moderate pathway. On the downside, factors such as significant technical issues, regulatory clampdowns, negative shifts in user sentiment, or even a high-profile backlash could depress engagement, leading to totals in the vicinity of 550 to 560 million likes. Conversely, if unexpected events occur—such as a surge from viral content, robust platform improvements, major celebrity endorsements, or rapid global expansion—the total likes could escalate considerably, potentially reaching levels in the range of 750 to 800 million likes.

Overall, while the central expectation rests on moderate growth culminating in roughly 625 million likes by June 28, 2025, the wide range of possible outcomes underscores the importance of unforeseen developments that could tilt the balance more favorably or unfavorably.
