The question of whether individuals cryopreserved between 2020 and 2050 will be revived by 2200 hinges on several key factors. Currently, the status quo outcome is 0%, as no human or mammal has been successfully revived from a cryopreserved state as of 2025. If current trends continue, the likelihood of revival remains exceedingly low, potentially less than 0.1%, due to significant technical challenges and the absence of precedent in successful revival.

Experts in neuroscience and cryobiology are generally skeptical about the feasibility of revival. The primary technical hurdles include cryoprotectant toxicity, ice damage, and the complexity of restoring neural structures. The market's focus is predominantly on cell and tissue preservation rather than whole-body revival, reflecting the speculative nature of the field.

Unexpected scenarios could alter these prospects. On the low end, even if a breakthrough in cryopreservation technology occurs, it might only enable the revival of a very small number of individuals due to high costs, limited applicability, or ethical and legal barriers. Societal and ethical concerns could further impede progress, keeping cryonics a niche interest with limited practical application.

Conversely, a high outcome scenario could emerge from revolutionary advances in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. These could lead to the development of reliable methods for repairing cellular and neural damage at a molecular level, making revival more accessible and affordable. Such breakthroughs could spur increased investment and interest, potentially resulting in a significant percentage of individuals being revived by 2200.
