Taiwan’s diplomatic recognition by UN member states is in a period of persistent decline, primarily due to sustained and intensifying pressure from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). As of early 2025, Taiwan is formally recognized by either 11 or 12 UN member states, depending on the reporting date; this number has decreased steadily from 13 in 2024. The loss of allies typically averages one to two countries per year, with those most vulnerable being in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific, where China has expanded its economic and diplomatic incentives.

China’s global influence campaign leverages economic inducements, development finance, and diplomatic engagement to persuade Taiwan’s remaining allies to switch recognition. This offensive is supported by significant agreements and projects, particularly through China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and has resulted in a decisive majority of countries now supporting Beijing’s position. In parallel, China’s military posture in the region, including increased exercises and incursions, adds further pressure on countries considering a shift in their diplomatic alignments.

US policy is a key variable: the United States continues to provide bipartisan support for Taiwan, with Congress reaffirming commitment to counter Chinese pressure. However, uncertainty around future US strategies—including how U.S. diplomatic and military resources are allocated in response to broader geopolitical shifts, such as the US focus on China and potential disengagement from other global theaters—creates unpredictability for Taiwan’s international standing. Stronger, coordinated US and European support could temporarily stabilize Taiwan’s position or prevent further losses, while a reduction in such backing could accelerate the trend of diplomatic attrition.

Unexpected scenarios could dramatically alter Taiwan’s diplomatic fortunes. On the downside, a major Chinese diplomatic or economic offensive, the emergence of political crises in allied countries, or a coordinated PRC push in vulnerable regions could precipitate multiple simultaneous recognition switches, reducing the number of Taiwan’s formal allies much more rapidly—potentially to as low as eight or nine. Conversely, a sharp escalation in US-PRC tensions, unprecedented international backlash against Beijing, or a significant realignment in the global order could, in rare cases, halt or even reverse this trend—allowing Taiwan to retain its current allies or very improbably reacquire lost recognition.

Overall, the consensus among experts is that—barring an extraordinary geopolitical event—the slow erosion of Taiwan’s formal ties is likely to continue through 2025, with a plausible range at year’s end between 9 and 12 UN member states recognizing Taiwan. This reflects both the momentum of China’s campaign and the resilience, but mounting vulnerability, of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic relationships.
