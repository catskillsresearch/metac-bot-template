The current state of knowledge and historical context suggest that while a draw is considered likely with perfect play, this is not a certainty or a proof. Zermelo's theorem allows for three possible outcomes: a win for White, a win for Black, or a forced draw. The prevailing opinion among chess theorists leans towards a draw, but the complexity of chess and the lack of significant breakthroughs in solving it from the initial position contribute to a high degree of uncertainty. The status quo heavily favors this uncertainty, as the world changes slowly and the intricate nature of chess makes it improbable that a definitive solution will be found soon. Therefore, while a forced draw remains a possibility, it is not overwhelmingly more probable than the other outcomes. The likelihood of a definitive solution emerging in the near future is low, and the status quo outcome, where chess remains unsolved, should be given considerable weight.
