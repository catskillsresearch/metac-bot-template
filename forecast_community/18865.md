## Rationale for the Likelihood of Ukraine Regaining De-Facto Control Over Donetsk and Luhansk Before 2030

The military and political situation in eastern Ukraine continues to reflect deep entrenchment and inertia. As of mid-2025, Russia occupies nearly the entire Luhansk Oblast and around three-quarters of Donetsk Oblast, including all the major cities in these regions. Ukrainian forces have managed only marginal territorial gains over the past two years, and the front lines have largely stabilized into a war of attrition with neither side demonstrating the capability for substantial breakthroughs.

**Russian Control and Integration Efforts:**  
Russia has entrenched its occupation through military fortification, comprehensive administrative integration, and targeted rebuilding (especially in Luhansk), while asserting maximalist demands in negotiations, such as requiring total Ukrainian withdrawal from the claimed territories as a precondition for any ceasefire. Russia’s ongoing incremental advances and consolidation efforts suggest a determination to maintain or expand its footprint, even as its ability to conduct successful major offensives is limited. The trend is toward further administrative and infrastructural integration of these regions into the Russian Federation, with Russian authorities treating Donetsk and Luhansk as constitutionally integral parts of Russia.

**Diplomatic and Political Environment:**  
Recent peace proposals and negotiations increasingly acknowledge the likelihood of a “frozen conflict,” with discussions centering on security guarantees for Ukraine—rather than full restoration of borders. Western diplomatic efforts hint at potential acceptance, at least de facto, of Russia’s occupation of these territories, invoking models akin to the Korean armistice, which would indefinitely freeze the conflict along existing front lines. Russia’s firm position, as articulated in its constitutional claims and ceasefire preconditions, leaves little room for voluntary withdrawal from these oblasts.

**Ukrainian and Western Constraints:**  
Ukraine faces significant limitations in its ability to reclaim the lost territories. The slow pace and conditionality of Western military aid, manpower challenges, and the formidable Russian defensive posture all impede the prospect of a successful large-scale counteroffensive. Although scenarios involving a sudden collapse of Russian resolve or a dramatic surge in Western support are theoretically possible, there is currently no substantial evidence pointing toward such transformative changes on the horizon.

**Precedent and Status Quo Bias:**  
International experience with comparable conflicts—such as those in Cyprus, Korea, or the post-WWII Baltic states—demonstrates that de facto territorial divisions tend to persist for decades unless disrupted by overwhelming force or internal collapse of the occupying power. In the absence of credible signs of a dramatic shift, the status quo should be weighted most heavily in any forecast.

**Potential for Change:**  
A full Ukrainian restoration of control before 2030 would require an extraordinary alignment of factors: severe internal upheaval within Russia, withdrawal of Russian forces under extreme domestic or international pressure, or a massive and sustained increase in Western military support enabling Ukraine to rout Russian defenses and re-establish effective administration across the entire region. Currently, none of these scenarios appear likely based on available evidence and current trends.

**Summary:**  
Absent an unforeseen and dramatic change—such as regime collapse in Moscow, abrupt withdrawal of Russian forces, or an unprecedented Ukrainian military breakthrough—the prevailing dynamics strongly support the expectation that Russia will maintain de facto control over most of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts through at least 2030. The international diplomatic climate, military realities on the ground, and historical precedent all point toward a continued division of the region and a likely freezing of the conflict along current front lines.
