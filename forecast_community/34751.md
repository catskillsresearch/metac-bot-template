(a) **Time left until outcome is known:**  
- The Liga F season concluded on May 11, 2025, with Barcelona officially crowned champions.  
- The UEFA Women's Champions League final, featuring Barcelona vs. Arsenal, will be played on May 24, 2025.  
- Therefore, the definitive outcome will be known after May 24, 2025—about 11 days from the current date.

(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
- FC Barcelona has already secured the 2024/25 Liga F title with a commanding 9-0 win over Real Betis, making their lead unassailable[2][5].
- Barcelona is confirmed as a finalist for the UEFA Women's Champions League, where they will face Arsenal on May 24[2].
- If the season were to freeze now (before the Champions League final), only the domestic league title would be secured, not both—a "No" outcome as per the question's criteria.

(c) **Scenario for a No outcome:**  
- Barcelona loses to Arsenal in the Champions League final on May 24, 2025. Despite their domestic dominance and recent form, a single defeat in a final would prevent them from securing both the Liga F and Champions League titles, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(d) **Scenario for a Yes outcome:**  
- Barcelona defeats Arsenal in the Champions League final, adding the continental trophy to their Liga F title. This would mean winning both major titles in the 2024/25 season, satisfying the "Yes" criteria.

## Rationale and Probability Assessment

Barcelona's track record in recent years has been exceptional:  
- They have won six consecutive Liga F titles and are the dominant force in Spain and Europe[2][5].
- Their 2024/25 league campaign was marked by an overwhelming points total, high-scoring wins, and record goal difference, even though they suffered two defeats in the league—more than in any of their previous five campaigns[5].
- Ewa Pajor leads both the league and overall team scoring, highlighting their attacking depth[2].

**Current status:**  
- Barcelona has completed the Liga F season as champions, fulfilling the first half of the double[2][5].
- They are scheduled to face Arsenal in the Champions League final, with form and experience on their side but with the outcome undecided as of now[2].

**Finals are unpredictable** in knockout football, but Barcelona's experience, talent (Ballon d'Or winners like Aitana Bonmatí, prolific scorers like Pajor), and recent Champions League pedigree (three titles since 2021) make them clear favorites. However, Arsenal, as finalists, have also demonstrated quality and the ability to win on the European stage.

**Forecaster's logic:**  
- The world changes slowly: Barcelona's dominance is entrenched, and their squad is at its peak.  
- However, single-game finals can hinge on small incidents: red cards, injuries, penalties, nerves. Even the strongest favorite loses finals (as history in both men's and women's football shows).
- Market odds in similar real-world situations for a favorite of Barcelona's caliber in a major final would typically run from 60%–75% to win, depending on relative team strength.

**Status quo moderately favors Yes (probability >50%)** due to Barcelona's clear superiority and recent form, but not overwhelmingly so due to the high-variance nature of a one-off final.

**Probability: 72%**  

- This reflects Barcelona's exceptional dominance, recent Champions League pedigree, and current unbeaten run in high-stakes matches, balanced against the inherent unpredictability of a cup final against a quality Arsenal side. The most likely outcome is that Barcelona will complete the double, but an Arsenal win remains a credible risk.
