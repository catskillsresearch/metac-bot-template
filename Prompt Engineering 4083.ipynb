      "Gambling addiction is worse than substance abuse in many ways, including higher suicide rates, according to Andrew Schlafly, Esq. in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. A Swedish study found that the rate of suicide is 15 times higher among gamblers than in the general population. Physical health problems and psychiatric harm are also common among gamblers, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and major depressive episodes. Roughly half of Americans are engaged in gambling, and extreme addiction afflicts about 5% of the population. Schlafly warns that the rise of AI-powered gambling on cell phones, particularly among teenagers, is a growing concern. He also notes that the 2018 Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. NCAA has led to the legalization of sports gambling in 39 states, resulting in $57.2 billion in annual wagers. Schlafly suggests that the Major Questions Doctrine could help limit the spread of this madness, but warns that a new way to bet on event contracts, which is federally regulated, could make corruption inevitable.\n",

      "A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The study, conducted by researchers from Columbia University and the University of Michigan, analyzed data from nearly 200,000 mothers participating in the National Survey of Children's Health. The results showed a decrease in the percentage of mothers reporting 'excellent' mental health, from 38% in 2016 to 26% in 2023, and an increase in the number of mothers rating their mental health as 'fair/poor', from 5.5% to 9%. According to Jamie Daw, an assistant professor of health policy and management at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, 'Although high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality have been well documented, national data on the health status of mothers beyond pregnancy and the first year postpartum is lacking.' The decline in mental health was observed across nearly every socioeconomic subgroup examined and is expected to have a negative impact on children's development. \n",

Rod Skyles notes that consumer, corporate, and government debt is 'out of control' and interest rates are building at a rapid rate.

      "The U.S. money supply, specifically M2, has been making history on both ends of the spectrum. It declined by more than $1 trillion between April 2022 and October 2023, marking the first time since the Great Depression that M2 has declined by at least 2% on a year-over-year basis. This decline has been followed by a record high for M2, reaching $21.863 trillion in April 2025. The correlation between declines in M2 money supply and trouble for the U.S. economy and Wall Street is strong, but the likelihood of a depression taking shape in modern times is extremely low. Nevertheless, a first-in-90-years decline in M2 money supply heightened the possibility of a near-term U.S. recession. However, patience has an immaculate track record of forecasting the future, with every rolling 20-year period of total return data from 1900 to 2024 producing a positive annualized rate of return. This suggests that stocks may be extra volatile in the quarters and years to come, but patient investors should not be alarmed.\n",

      "A recent study has shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can have long-term effects on patients with severe depression. The study, conducted by an international team of researchers, involved 493 patients who had not responded to previous treatments. The participants were fitted with a device that stimulated the vagus nerve, which is responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to various vital organs. The results showed that patients who received the treatment experienced improvements in their depression symptoms, quality of life, and ability to perform daily tasks. According to Dr. Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis, 'Before joining this study, patients had tried an average of 13 treatments, all of which failed to help them, and they spent more than half of their lives suffering from depression.' He added, 'Despite this high level of chronic illness, we still observe significant and meaningful improvements in depression symptoms, quality of life, and functional outcomes.' While VNS has shown promise in treating depression, the evidence for its success has not always been clear-cut, making the treatment expensive for many patients in the US, especially those relying on insurance. However, the study's results are promising, particularly in helping patients overcome the psychological paralysis that often accompanies severe depression. Conway said, 'What matters here is that patients themselves reported improvements in their lives,' and added, 'They express meaningful improvements in their ability to function and live normally.' Up to 30% of patients with severe depression do not respond to traditional antidepressants, leading to a deterioration of their mental health and increased risk of suicide, hospitalization, and disability. This model of clinical trials is currently being used to determine whether VNS can also make a difference for patients with bipolar disorder. The researchers aim to continue the study for an additional four years to assess whether the benefits are more pronounced in certain groups of patients. Conway said, 'The unique thing about vagus nerve stimulation is that we know from previous studies that when the patient responds to the treatment, the effects often remain stable.'\n",

Kiyosaki cites record-high credit card debt, ballooning national liabilities, rising unemployment, and shrinking retirement savings as signs of an impending economic unraveling. He predicts that the next downturn will eclipse the 2008 crash and make the 1930s look minor by comparison. Kiyosaki advises people to pivot into what he considers the only real shelters left: Bitcoin, gold, and silver, saying, 'For those who take action today, when the crash crashes, those who invest in just one Bitcoin, or some gold, or silver... You may come through this crisis a very rich person.' He also predicts that one Bitcoin will be over $1 million by 2035, gold will be $30K, and silver will be $3,000 a coin.\n",

      "Despite predictions of economic damage, President Trump's massive import taxes, or tariffs, have not yet had a significant impact on the US economy. However, economists warn that the tariffs are still a concern, as they are unpredictable and have only just begun to take effect. The tariffs, which are the highest since the Great Depression, have been imposed on almost every country on earth, with an average tariff rate of 17.8%, the highest since 1934. While some companies, such as Walmart, have warned of price increases, consumers are less willing to accept higher prices, and many companies are absorbing some of the tariff costs. The economic damage doesn't just come from the cost of tariffs, but also from the erratic way the president imposes them. As one economist noted, 'We had a good jobs report. We had a cool inflation report, and that’s great. But that should not give us comfort about what next month will be, particularly on inflation.' \n",

He warns that the next few months will be a down year, with the S&P expected to drop to 4,000, resulting in a 50% loss of money for those in bad stocks. Nenner believes that 2026 will be 'much worse' due to the cycles in 1928 and 1929 being in the same position as 2025 and 2026. He also predicts a DOW at 5,000, which is significantly lower than its current value of nearly 39,000. Nenner attributes his bearish outlook to the potential for a big war between China and Taiwan, which he believes has a 50/50 chance of occurring. He still likes gold for the long term and expects silver to start catching up in May. Nenner also thinks interest rates are still in a long-term trend up, but there can be pullbacks, and the US dollar will not fall much more for now.\n",

      "Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, has been nominated to serve as the director of the National Institutes of Health. Bhattacharya argues that the global economic depression caused by continued lockdowns will kill large numbers of people and calls for widespread seroprevalence tests to understand the severity of the disease. He believes that the epidemic is more widespread than believed, with many people having been infected with the virus and cleared it without being tested. Bhattacharya estimates that the actual number of people infected could be 50-85 times the number of confirmed cases, citing a study in Santa Clara that found a prevalence of 2-4% among 2 million people. He advocates for population-level seroprevalence testing to determine the true extent of the epidemic and to inform policy decisions. Bhattacharya also emphasizes the need to consider the economic costs of lockdowns, including the lives lost due to the global economic depression. He believes that making policy decisions in the midst of fear is a bad idea and that we need to 'shine the light of science on this' to make better decisions.\n",

      "- Severity score: 1131 (43 × 26.3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic conditions as of early 2020 showed several concerning patterns that could potentially contribute to economic instability:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Extended bull market and economic expansion following the 2008-2009 financial crisis\n",
      "- High corporate debt levels and potential asset bubbles\n",
      "- Growing federal budget deficits even during economic expansion\n",
      "- Global trade tensions affecting supply chains\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Factors Affecting Depression Probability\n",
      "\n",
      "### Economic Growth Projections\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic forecasts available in early 2020 generally projected moderate but slowing growth for the coming decade. While some economists had raised concerns about a potential recession in the near term, few were projecting a depression-level event within the 2022-2032 timeframe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some economic research firms have been forecasting a potential \"Great Depression\" scenario for the 2030s, which falls partially within our resolution timeframe[2]. However, these forecasts typically point to the latter part of the 2030s, mostly outside our resolution window.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Federal Fiscal Position\n",
      "\n",
      "The US federal deficit and debt positions were already concerning before 2020:\n",
      "- Growing deficits despite economic expansion\n",
      "- Federal debt approaching 100% of GDP\n",
      "- Increasing entitlement spending pressures\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors reduce the government's fiscal flexibility to respond to severe economic downturns.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Monetary Policy Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "As of early 2020, key monetary policy considerations included:\n",
      "- Interest rates already at historically low levels\n",
      "- Federal Reserve balance sheet still expanded from previous interventions\n",
      "- Limited room for conventional monetary policy responses to a severe downturn\n",
      "\n",
      "## Probabilistic Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on pre-April 2020 information, I assess the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Probability of a depression meeting the specified criteria (2022-2032)**: Approximately 15-20%\n",
      "   - Most likely scenario remains continued economic cycles without depression-level severity\n",
      "   - The probability is elevated compared to historical baselines due to systemic vulnerabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Conditional severity assessment** (if a depression occurs):\n",
      "   - Expected relative severity: 0.3-0.7 times the Great Depression\n",
      "   - This translates to approximately 340-790 on the severity scale (where Great Depression = 1131)\n",
      "   - Key factors: stronger institutional safeguards and policy tools compared to 1929, but potentially less fiscal/monetary flexibility\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Most likely scenario**:\n",
      "   - If a depression occurs, it would likely feature:\n",
      "   - Duration: 24-36 months (shorter than Great Depression)\n",
      "   - GDP decline: 12-18% (less severe than Great Depression's 26.3%)\n",
      "   - Resulting in a severity score of approximately 290-650 (0.25-0.58× Great Depression)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations and Uncertainties\n",
      "\n",
      "Several important limitations affect this forecast:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Economic forecasting becomes increasingly uncertain beyond 2-3 year horizons\n",
      "2. The resolution criteria's specific thresholds (36+ months or -10% annual GDP) create discontinuities in assessment\n",
      "3. Historical sample size of depression-level events is extremely small, limiting statistical inference\n",
      "4. Structural changes in the economy make direct historical comparisons challenging\n",
      "5. The definition of \"depression\" itself lacks universal consensus among economists\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the title, news and research, make a forecast according to the formulas you derived in the previous prompt response.\n",
      "If the Python function has multiple variables, assess each variable individually and then use the function to compute the measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing you write is your final answer as this sequence of percentile levels in percent and values as floating point numbers without currency symbols, commas or spelled out numbers like \"trillion\", just the raw complete number:\n",
      "\"\n",
      "Percentile 10: XX\n",

      "Percentile 40: XX\n",
      "Percentile 60: XX\n",
      "Percentile 80: XX\n",
      "Percentile 90: XX\n",
      "\"\n",
      "Each line of the final answer MUST START with the word \"Percentile\".  For example if you have \"10: 201\" instead of \"Percentile 10: 201\", that is wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE ANSWER MUST BE IN THE TERMS REQUESTED BY THE PROBLEM.  \n",
      "A QUICK CORRECTNESS CHECK IS THAT YOUR ANSWER MUST LIE BETWEEN THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES SPECIFIED.  \n",
      "THE REQUESTED TERMS ARE AS FOLLOWS:\n",
      "\n",
      "```terms\n",
      "a. The minimum value for the answer is 0.1. This would occur if there is an economic depression with the shortest possible duration (just over 36 months) and the smallest possible real GDP decline (-10%).\n",
      "\n",
      "b. The maximum value for the answer is 10.0. This would occur if there is an economic depression with the longest possible duration and the largest possible real GDP decline. However, the exact maximum is not specified, so 10.0 is the upper bound of the scale provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Yes, there is a formula for the answer given in the text. The relative severity is defined as:\n",
      "\\[ \\text{Relative Severity} = \\frac{\\text{Number of months the depression lasts} \\times \\text{Real GDP decline in percentage points (peak to trough)}}{1131} \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "d. The formula requires two inputs:\n",
      "1. The number of months the depression lasts.\n",
      "2. The real GDP decline in percentage points (peak to trough).\n",
      "\n",
      "These can be estimated using the resolution criteria provided:\n",
      "- The number of months can be determined by the duration of the recession (if it lasts 36 months or longer) or by the year's annual real GDP growth (if it is -10% or less).\n",
      "- The real GDP decline can be estimated from the data reported by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a Python function that implements the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def calculate_relative_severity(depression_duration_months, real_gdp_decline_percent):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Calculate the relative severity of a US depression compared to the Great Depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Parameters:\n",
      "    depression_duration_months (int): The number of months the depression lasts.\n",
      "    real_gdp_decline_percent (float): The real GDP decline in percentage points (peak to trough).\n",
      "\n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "    float: The relative severity of the depression.\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    relative_severity = (depression_duration_months * real_gdp_decline_percent) / 1131\n",
      "    return relative_severity\n",
      "\n",
      "# Example usage:\n",
      "# depression_duration_months = 43  # Example duration\n",
      "# real_gdp_decline_percent = 26.3  # Example GDP decline\n",
      "# relative_severity = calculate_relative_severity(depression_duration_months, real_gdp_decline_percent)\n",
      "# print(relative_severity)\n",
      "```\n",
