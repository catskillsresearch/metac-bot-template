      "Data from [SPINS](https://www.spins.com/) summarised by the Plant Based Foods Association and The Good Food Institute shows U.S. retail sales of plant-based alternative foods have grown 11 percent in the past year, and 31% over the past two years ([Good Food Institute, 2019](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#section-intro)). By comparison, total U.S. retail food dollar sales grew just 2% over the past year and 4% over the past two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings the total plant-based alternatives market value to a total value of $4.5 billion in 2019. At [an estimated $801M](https://plantbasedfoods.org/2019-data-plant-based-market/) the plant-based meat market is the second highest grossing plant-based alternatives product, after plant-based milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most dollar-sales of plant-based meat tend to come from frozen products (73% in 2019). However, this seems to changing quickly: product innovation and merchandising strategies have grown dollar sales of refrigerated plant-based meat by 85% ([Good Food Institute, 2019](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#section-intro)). \n",

      "\n",
      "This question will resolve as the value of the U.S. market for plant-based meat, as estimated by [SPINS](https://www.spins.com/). The market value is to be adjusted for inflation using a widely used CPI and given in 2019 prices. SPINS' estimate of the value of the U.S. market for plant-based meat is given by the sum of the value of the US market for the following subcategories of plant-based alternatives: meat based burgers, nuggets, strips and cutlets, links, patties, grounds, deli slices, meatballs, loafs/roasts, shreds/pulled, jerky and other plant-based meats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the event that the only data available is that for the year ending in December, and if it cannot be constructed or obtained any other way (such as by using the following year's data release, or by contacting the relevant organisation), then this question shall resolve as the total value of the market for the year ending in December of the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The question resolves ambiguously if SPINS data is substantially different in 2023 compared with 2019. SPINS data is to be considered to be substantially different if the methodology for estimating the size of the market is substantially changed, such as when using the new methodology, estimates of the historical size of the market (currently $584m in 2017, $731m in 2018, $801m in 2019, with all years ending in April) changes by more than 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case SPINS data is not available, it is left to the discretion of an admin to either resolve this question ambiguous, or consult an alternative estimate. However, this alternative estimate should only be used if it is judged that this estimation approach is at least 90% likely produce an estimate within 50% of the estimate obtained by following the SPINS methodology, subject to updates considered reasonable in case new plant-based subcategories emerge, or previously existing subcategories that were excluded from earlier SPINS estimates constitute a larger share of the total value.\n",

      "- In 2019, the U.S. plant-based meat market was valued at $801 million, based on SPINS data for the year ending April 2019[1].\n",
      "- Between 2017 and 2019, annual growth rates averaged 11–12% (from $584M in 2017 to $801M in 2019)[1].\n",
      "- As of 2021, North America’s plant-based meat market was estimated at $1.76 billion (not U.S.-only), projected to reach $4.98 billion by 2028, implying a 16% CAGR for the region[5].\n",
      "- Statista’s U.S.-specific forecast estimates the market at $1.43 billion in 2025, with a 2.81% CAGR from 2025 to 2030[1].\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Slowing Growth:** The growth rate is projected to decline from the double-digit pace of the late 2010s to low-to-mid single digits by 2025–2030 according to Statista[1].\n",
      "- **Market Maturity:** Early rapid growth may have been driven by novelty, new product launches, and increased distribution; as the market matures, growth is expected to slow.\n",
      "- **Regional Scope:** Some projections are for North America, not the U.S. alone, so require adjustment downward for the U.S.-only market.\n",
      "- **Inflation Adjustment:** All figures should be in 2019 dollars, but most recent forecasts do not specify real vs. nominal terms, introducing some uncertainty.\n",
      "- **SPINS Methodology:** If the methodology for measuring the market changes substantially, estimates may not be directly comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Calculation Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Baseline:** $801M in 2019 (SPINS, U.S. only).\n",
      "2. **Growth Rate:** \n",
      "   - Historical (2017–2019): ~12% CAGR.\n",
      "   - North America projection (2021–2028): 16% CAGR[5].\n",
      "   - Statista (U.S., 2025–2030): 2.81% CAGR[1].\n",
      "3. **Best Estimate for U.S. (2023–2028):** Given decelerating growth, a blended CAGR between 6–10% is plausible, recognizing that North America’s 16% likely overstates U.S.-only growth for the late 2020s.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scenario Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Low Case (3% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.03^5) ≈ $1,460M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "- **Base Case (7% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.07^5) ≈ $1,770M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "- **High Case (12% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.12^5) ≈ $2,220M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "\n",
      "(Assuming $1,260M for 2023, an extrapolation from $801M in 2019 at 12% CAGR to 2023, then projecting forward.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Adjustment to 2019 dollars:** If cumulative inflation from 2019–2028 is about 20% (2% per year average), then adjust down by ~17% (divide by 1.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Probabilistic Forecast\n",
      "\n",
      "- **60% probability:** U.S. market for plant-based meat will be $1,400M–$1,600M (2019 USD) in the year ending April 2028.\n",
      "- **30% probability:** Exceeds $1,600M (2019 USD), up to $2,000M, if higher adoption resumes.\n",
      "- **10% probability:** Falls below $1,400M (2019 USD), if category stagnates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations and Uncertainties\n",
      "\n",
      "- Forecasts depend on consumer adoption, innovation, and competitive pressures.\n",
      "- Methodological changes in SPINS reporting could affect comparability.\n",
      "- Market shocks (e.g., regulatory changes, new entrants) could accelerate or slow growth.\n",
      "- Inflation adjustment is an estimate; actual CPI may differ.\n",

      "Rügenwalder Mühle, a company that has been producing sausages and ham for over 190 years, has seen significant growth in its plant-based alternatives. Despite having a market share of 43% in the chilled meat alternatives market, the company is concerned about the increasing number of competitors. The company's CEO, Herr Pfirrmann, stated that the market has become 'oversaturated' with around 50 competitors. However, the company remains optimistic about the future of plant-based meat alternatives, with a predicted market share of 12% in the next 5 years. The company has also seen a significant increase in sales, with a growth rate of 9% in the first quarter of 2025, while the industry as a whole saw a decline of 6%. The company attributes this success to its focus on taste and quality, rather than price. The CEO also expressed concerns about the impact of the Lieferkettengesetz (Supply Chain Act) on the company's operations, but remains committed to sustainability and reducing its environmental footprint.\n",

By comparison, total U.S. retail food dollar sales grew just 2% over the past year and 4% over the past two years.\\n\\nThis brings the total plant-based alternatives market value to a total value of $4.5 billion in 2019. At [an estimated $801M](https://plantbasedfoods.org/2019-data-plant-based-market/) the plant-based meat market is the second highest grossing plant-based alternatives product, after plant-based milk.\\n\\nMost dollar-sales of plant-based meat tend to come from frozen products (73% in 2019). However, this seems to changing quickly: product innovation and merchandising strategies have grown dollar sales of refrigerated plant-based meat by 85% ([Good Food Institute, 2019](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#section-intro)). \\n\\n**What will the U.S. market for plant-based meat be worth in the year ending in April 2028, in millions of 2019 USD?**\\n\\nThis question will resolve as the value of the U.S. market for plant-based meat, as estimated by [SPINS](https://www.spins.com/). The market value is to be adjusted for inflation using a widely used CPI and given in 2019 prices. SPINS' estimate of the value of the U.S. market for plant-based meat is given by the sum of the value of the US market for the following subcategories of plant-based alternatives: meat based burgers, nuggets, strips and cutlets, links, patties, grounds, deli slices, meatballs, loafs/roasts, shreds/pulled, jerky and other plant-based meats.\\n\\nIn the event that the only data available is that for the year ending in December, and if it cannot be constructed or obtained any other way (such as by using the following year's data release, or by contacting the relevant organisation), then this question shall resolve as the total value of the market for the year ending in December of the previous year.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe question resolves ambiguously if SPINS data is substantially different in 2023 compared with 2019. SPINS data is to be considered to be substantially different if the methodology for estimating the size of the market is substantially changed, such as when using the new methodology, estimates of the historical size of the market (currently $584m in 2017, $731m in 2018, $801m in 2019, with all years ending in April) changes by more than 50%.\\n\\nIn case SPINS data is not available, it is left to the discretion of an admin to either resolve this question ambiguous, or consult an alternative estimate. However, this alternative estimate should only be used if it is judged that this estimation approach is at least 90% likely produce an estimate within 50% of the estimate obtained by following the SPINS methodology, subject to updates considered reasonable in case new plant-based subcategories emerge, or previously existing subcategories that were excluded from earlier SPINS estimates constitute a larger share of the total value.\""

Despite having a market share of 43% in the chilled meat alternatives market, the company is concerned about the increasing number of competitors. The company's CEO, Herr Pfirrmann, stated that the market has become 'oversaturated' with around 50 competitors. However, the company remains optimistic about the future of plant-based meat alternatives, with a predicted market share of 12% in the next 5 years. The company has also seen a significant increase in sales, with a growth rate of 9% in the first quarter of 2025, while the industry as a whole saw a decline of 6%. The company attributes this success to its focus on taste and quality, rather than price. The CEO also expressed concerns about the impact of the Lieferkettengesetz (Supply Chain Act) on the company's operations, but remains committed to sustainability and reducing its environmental footprint.\n",

      "- In 2019, the U.S. plant-based meat market was valued at $801 million, based on SPINS data for the year ending April 2019[1].\n",
      "- Between 2017 and 2019, annual growth rates averaged 11–12% (from $584M in 2017 to $801M in 2019)[1].\n",
      "- As of 2021, North America’s plant-based meat market was estimated at $1.76 billion (not U.S.-only), projected to reach $4.98 billion by 2028, implying a 16% CAGR for the region[5].\n",
      "- Statista’s U.S.-specific forecast estimates the market at $1.43 billion in 2025, with a 2.81% CAGR from 2025 to 2030[1].\n",

      "\n",
      "## Key Differences Affecting the Forecast\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Slowing Growth:** The growth rate is projected to decline from the double-digit pace of the late 2010s to low-to-mid single digits by 2025–2030 according to Statista[1].\n",
      "- **Market Maturity:** Early rapid growth may have been driven by novelty, new product launches, and increased distribution; as the market matures, growth is expected to slow.\n",
      "- **Regional Scope:** Some projections are for North America, not the U.S. alone, so require adjustment downward for the U.S.-only market.\n",
      "- **Inflation Adjustment:** All figures should be in 2019 dollars, but most recent forecasts do not specify real vs. nominal terms, introducing some uncertainty.\n",
      "- **SPINS Methodology:** If the methodology for measuring the market changes substantially, estimates may not be directly comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Adjusted Probabilistic Assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "### Calculation Approach\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Baseline:** $801M in 2019 (SPINS, U.S. only).\n",
      "2. **Growth Rate:** \n",
      "   - Historical (2017–2019): ~12% CAGR.\n",
      "   - North America projection (2021–2028): 16% CAGR[5].\n",
      "   - Statista (U.S., 2025–2030): 2.81% CAGR[1].\n",
      "3. **Best Estimate for U.S. (2023–2028):** Given decelerating growth, a blended CAGR between 6–10% is plausible, recognizing that North America’s 16% likely overstates U.S.-only growth for the late 2020s.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Scenario Modeling\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Low Case (3% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.03^5) ≈ $1,460M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "- **Base Case (7% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.07^5) ≈ $1,770M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "- **High Case (12% CAGR):** $1,260M (2023) × (1.12^5) ≈ $2,220M (2028, in nominal USD)\n",
      "\n",
      "(Assuming $1,260M for 2023, an extrapolation from $801M in 2019 at 12% CAGR to 2023, then projecting forward.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Adjustment to 2019 dollars:** If cumulative inflation from 2019–2028 is about 20% (2% per year average), then adjust down by ~17% (divide by 1.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Probabilistic Forecast\n",
      "\n",
      "- **60% probability:** U.S. market for plant-based meat will be $1,400M–$1,600M (2019 USD) in the year ending April 2028.\n",
      "- **30% probability:** Exceeds $1,600M (2019 USD), up to $2,000M, if higher adoption resumes.\n",
      "- **10% probability:** Falls below $1,400M (2019 USD), if category stagnates.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Limitations and Uncertainties\n",
      "\n",
      "- Forecasts depend on consumer adoption, innovation, and competitive pressures.\n",
      "- Methodological changes in SPINS reporting could affect comparability.\n",
      "- Market shocks (e.g., regulatory changes, new entrants) could accelerate or slow growth.\n",
      "- Inflation adjustment is an estimate; actual CPI may differ.\n",

      "d. Since no formula is explicitly given, we cannot write a Python function for it. However, if we were to estimate the future market value based on historical growth rates (as mentioned in the text), we could use a simple compound annual growth rate (CAGR) approach.

      "1. This is a hypothetical function based on the assumption that the market will continue to grow at the same rate as observed in the past (11% annually). The actual future value will depend on SPINS data, which may not follow this simple growth model.\n",
      "2. The function does not account for inflation adjustments or changes in SPINS methodology, as these would require more specific data or additional assumptions.\n",
      "3. The resolution criteria emphasize that the answer should be based on SPINS data, so this function is only a rough estimate and not a substitute for the actual SPINS data.\n",

      "To forecast the future market value of plant-based meat in the U.S. in 2028, I will use the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) approach based on historical data. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Data Points:\n",
      "1. **Initial Value (2019):** $801 million (from SPINS data).\n",
      "2. **Historical Growth Rate (2017–2019):** 11–12% CAGR.\n",
      "3. **Projected Growth Rate (2025–2030):** 2.81% CAGR (from Statista).\n",
      "4. **Years to Project:** 2019 to 2028 = 9 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assumptions:\n",
      "- We'll use a blended growth rate to account for decelerating growth. A reasonable midpoint is 7% CAGR for the first 5 years (2019–2024) and 3% CAGR for the next 4 years (2024–2028).\n",
      "- Inflation adjustment is not applied here, as the problem does not specify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Calculation:\n",
      "1. **First 5 Years (2019–2024):**\n",
      "   - Future Value = $801M * (1 + 0.07)^5 ≈ $1,120M.\n",
      "2. **Next 4 Years (2024–2028):**\n",
      "   - Future Value = $1,120M * (1 + 0.03)^4 ≈ $1,260M.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Probabilistic Forecast:\n",
      "We'll model the uncertainty by varying the growth rates:\n",
      "- **Low Case (3% CAGR):** $801M * (1.03)^9 ≈ $1,050M.\n",
      "- **Base Case (7% CAGR):** $801M * (1.07)^9 ≈ $1,550M.\n",
      "- **High Case (12% CAGR):** $801M * (1.12)^9 ≈ $2,220M.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Answer:\n",
