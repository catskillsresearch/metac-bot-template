The question of how old the oldest living person will be in 2100 is influenced by several factors. Currently, the verified maximum human lifespan is 122 years, as held by Jeanne Calment. If no significant changes occur, the oldest living person would likely be around 115 years old, based on current records of the oldest living individuals. However, if the trend of modest increases in maximum lifespan continues, it is plausible that the oldest living person in 2100 might be around 125 to 135 years old. This expectation aligns with expert opinions, which generally anticipate a slight increase in maximum lifespan, assuming no revolutionary breakthroughs in anti-aging technology.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A global catastrophe, such as a pandemic or environmental disaster, could drastically reduce both average and maximum human lifespans, resulting in the oldest living person being around 110 years old. Conversely, a major breakthrough in anti-aging technology or genetic engineering could dramatically extend human lifespan, potentially allowing the oldest living person to reach 150 years or more. These scenarios highlight the uncertainty and potential variability in predicting future human lifespans.
