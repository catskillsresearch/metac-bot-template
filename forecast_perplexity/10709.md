China's CO2 emissions are likely to peak before 2030, with many indicators suggesting a peak could occur as early as 2025. This outlook is supported by current trends and expert assessments, which highlight the rapid deployment of renewable energy and strong policy commitments towards decarbonization. China's significant investments in renewable energy, coupled with its commitment to international climate agreements and domestic environmental goals, create a robust foundation for reducing emissions. The shift towards a more sustainable and innovation-driven economic model, with increased energy efficiency and electrification, further supports this trajectory.

However, there are potential scenarios that could delay this peak. A significant economic stimulus package focused on fossil fuel-intensive industries, such as heavy industry and infrastructure, could lead to a resurgence in emissions. This could be exacerbated by global economic downturns or geopolitical tensions that disrupt energy markets, prompting China to prioritize short-term economic growth over environmental commitments. Additionally, any slowdown in renewable energy deployment or policy reversals favoring coal could also hinder progress.

Despite these uncertainties, the momentum towards a low-carbon economy appears strong. The combination of policy support, expert assessments, and recent trends in emissions reductions all point towards an earlier peak. While economic fluctuations and policy changes pose risks, the overall trajectory suggests that China's CO2 emissions are on track to peak before 2030.
