The 2025 reconciliation bill is poised to enact the largest Medicaid spending cuts in U.S. history, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and leading policy experts projecting a total reduction of at least $700 billion from Fiscal Year 2025 through FY 2034. The House of Representatives passed its version of the bill on May 22, 2025, and the outcome now hinges on Senate negotiations and the final signed legislation, with approximately four months remaining before the end-of-year deadline for passage.

If no reconciliation bill is enacted by September 30, 2025, there will be no change in Medicaid spending and the question of reductions would be annulled. However, current legislative momentum suggests that, barring significant amendments, the final bill is likely to closely follow the House-passed version, which centers on several core provisions to reduce Medicaid expenditures:

- **Eligibility Verification and Work Requirements:** The bill introduces more frequent eligibility checks (every six months instead of annually) and stricter verification protocols. Able-bodied adults aged 19–64 without dependents would be subject to mandatory work requirements (at least 80 hours per month) to maintain Medicaid eligibility.
- **Targeted Funding Reductions:** States covering undocumented immigrants would face a 10% reduction in federal Medicaid funding, and the legislation also addresses tighter limits on permissible home equity for beneficiaries.
- **Potential for Additional Cuts:** The House Energy and Commerce Committee set a target of up to $880 billion in healthcare savings, leaving open the possibility that the final bill could include even more aggressive Medicaid provisions if the Senate pursues greater offsets for other priorities.

According to preliminary CBO analysis and major think tank forecasts, these changes would strip health insurance from approximately 8.6 million current Medicaid enrollees by 2034, with even larger overall losses in coverage across related programs if associated Affordable Care Act provisions expire as planned. While a $715 billion figure has circulated, this may include savings outside Medicaid; the best-supported Medicaid-only estimate remains at least $700 billion in cumulative federal spending reductions.

There is, however, considerable uncertainty depending on how the Senate approaches the bill. If moderate Senators or state governors succeed in dialing back the most severe Medicaid cuts—such as eliminating or softening work requirements or verification rules—the final reduction could fall to the $300–$500 billion range, or potentially result in no cuts if the bill fails to pass. Conversely, if the Senate preserves or intensifies the House Medicaid provisions, or adds further restrictions (such as block grants or per-capita caps), total cuts could reach or slightly exceed the full committee target of $880 billion.

Despite the wide range of possibilities, expert consensus places the most probable outcome between $700 and $800 billion in Medicaid spending reductions over the decade, with the final figure contingent upon Senate negotiations and last-minute legislative revisions. This outcome reflects a policy choice to offset other federal spending priorities—such as tax cut extensions—by reducing funding for Medicaid, with profound implications for low-income populations, states, and the broader health coverage landscape.
