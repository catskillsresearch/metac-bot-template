The historical context and current geopolitical environment suggest that the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, established over four decades ago, remains robust. Both nations have consistently demonstrated a preference for maintaining peace and focusing on deterrence, despite regional tensions and public opposition in Egypt. The absence of direct military conflict causing significant casualties since the 1978 Camp David Accords underscores the strength of this treaty.

Several factors contribute to the low likelihood of a large-scale military conflict between Egypt and Israel. Both countries have strong incentives to avoid war, including the high economic and human costs associated with such a conflict and significant international pressure, particularly from allies like the United States, to maintain stability in the region. Diplomatic efforts and cooperation on security issues, especially in sensitive areas like the Sinai, further reduce the chances of escalation.

However, potential risks remain. A significant political or regime change in either country could alter the current trajectory, potentially leading to a more aggressive stance. Additionally, unforeseen events, such as a major incident involving non-state actors or a severe miscalculation, could trigger a rapid escalation. Despite these risks, the probability of a direct military conflict resulting in 1,000 or more deaths remains low, given the current diplomatic and strategic environment. The international community's vested interest in regional stability acts as a further deterrent against large-scale hostilities.
