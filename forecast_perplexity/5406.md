Global economic output is projected by leading institutions to continue growing at moderate annual rates—typically between 2% and 2.8%—through 2050. This sustained, incremental growth means the world economy can be expected to double in size approximately every 25–35 years, but not in any four-year period. To achieve a doubling of output in just four years would require an extraordinary and sustained compound annual growth rate of about 18%—a level entirely without precedent in global economic history, where even the fastest-growing economies have failed to sustain such rates at scale for prolonged intervals.

No mainstream economic forecast, including those from sources like PwC, Goldman Sachs, and the IMF, anticipates global growth anywhere close to this magnitude. The fastest projected national growth rates among major economies through the 2050s (for example, India at 3.1% and the Philippines at 3.5% annually) fall dramatically short of what would be needed to drive a worldwide 4-year doubling, and the aggregate effect of emerging economies is insufficient to meaningfully accelerate the global average.

Historical cases of rapid economic expansion—such as China’s industrialization—have produced high national growth, but global GDP growth has never surpassed low-single-digit percentages for sustained periods. The principal headwinds forecast for the coming decades—including aging populations, environmental constraints, and slowing productivity gains—further lower the likelihood of a structural acceleration in growth rates.

The only conceivable scenario for world output to double in a four-year interval involves a revolutionary technological breakthrough, most plausibly an explosive advance in general-purpose artificial intelligence. Such an event could, in theory, trigger self-reinforcing productivity gains across all sectors, driving unprecedented economic expansion. However, these scenarios remain speculative; they are not reflected in any authoritative forecasting or present-day economic projection, and significant real-world frictions—such as limits in physical infrastructure, energy, and regulatory adaptation—would likely impede instantaneous global adoption even if such technology emerged.

In summary, all authoritative projections and historical evidence point to the world economy continuing on a moderate growth path, with a four-year doubling of output requiring radical and unproven changes that current consensus does not anticipate. The probability of such an event before 2050 is exceedingly remote in the absence of a transformative and rapidly spreading technological revolution.
