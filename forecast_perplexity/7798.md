Tom Tugendhat's prospects for becoming the UK Conservative Party Leader before 2030 are currently limited due to several key factors. His repeated failures to secure broad parliamentary backing in leadership contests and his lack of Cabinet experience are significant obstacles. The Conservative Party's current ideological leanings favor candidates with more right-wing profiles and Cabinet experience, which does not align with Tugendhat's moderate stance.

For Tugendhat to become the leader, a significant ideological shift within the Conservative Party towards more centrist or moderate policies would be necessary. This shift could be driven by changing public opinion, electoral pressures, or significant electoral losses. Additionally, Tugendhat gaining Cabinet experience or a leadership crisis that discredits other leading figures could create an opportunity for him to rise to leadership. However, such changes are uncertain and speculative.

The status quo outcome, where Tugendhat does not become the leader, remains the most likely scenario given the current political landscape and historical trends. The Conservative Party's preference for leaders with Cabinet experience and right-wing credentials presents a formidable barrier. While political dynamics can change, these shifts often occur slowly, and the status quo tends to prevail. Therefore, unless there are significant shifts within the party or external events that create a favorable environment for Tugendhat's leadership, his chances remain low.
