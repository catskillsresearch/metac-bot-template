A China-India war by 2035, defined as an armed conflict resulting in at least 1,000 battle-related deaths in a single calendar year, must be evaluated in light of persistent territorial disputes, evolving regional dynamics, and each country’s strategic priorities.

The bilateral relationship remains fundamentally unstable despite periods of diplomatic engagement and limited progress in de-escalating border tensions. Recent developments, such as the disengagement agreements in eastern Ladakh and high-level summits emphasizing "mutual trust, mutual respect, and mutual sensitivity," have provided some stabilization, but have not resolved the core issues. Border disputes, particularly over areas like Arunachal Pradesh, continue to provoke flareups, and both sides maintain significant military deployments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

Episodes like the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict have introduced new complexities. China’s willingness to support Pakistan with military technology and intelligence highlights its preference for exerting pressure on India indirectly, using proxies to shape regional dynamics. This approach allows for competition and influence projection without the risks of direct military confrontation. Nevertheless, these actions can contribute to mistrust and serve as a catalyst for escalations at the China-India border, especially when combined with subsequent provocations such as China raising new claims on Indian territory.

China’s rapid military modernization—including a growing nuclear arsenal and enhanced power projection capabilities—adds to the sense of strategic competition. India, viewing China as its primary long-term adversary, has adapted its own military posture and sought new alignments, but faces challenges in matching China’s capabilities, especially in logistics and rapid force mobilization.

Despite these risks, there are robust mechanisms and incentives that reduce the likelihood of open war:

- **Nuclear deterrence** is a powerful brake on escalation, as both countries possess nuclear arsenals that raise the costs and risks of a conventional war spiraling out of control.
- **Economic interdependence** continues to tie the nations together, creating strong incentives for both sides to avoid a disruption that would be globally and domestically costly.
- **Geographic constraints**—particularly the difficult Himalayan terrain—raise the cost and complexity of any large-scale operation.
- **Diplomatic channels** remain active, with both countries showing a preference for crisis management through negotiation and confidence-building measures, such as buffer zones and bilateral dialogues.
- **Historical precedent** since the 1962 war demonstrates an enduring pattern: periodic skirmishes and standoffs have occurred, but there has been a consistent avoidance of escalation to high-casualty conflict. Even violent incidents such as the 2020 Galwan Valley clash were quickly contained.

Nevertheless, several persistent risks could drive escalation:

- **Unresolved border disputes** provide ongoing flashpoints; the imposition of buffer zones is controversial and sometimes viewed as unfavorable, especially on the Indian side.
- **Rising nationalism** in both countries can pressure leaders into taking uncompromising stances during crises, reducing policy flexibility.
- **Mutual distrust** and the absence of durable dispute resolution mechanisms mean that even minor incidents can escalate rapidly if diplomatic safeguards are overwhelmed.
- **Capability mismatch and rapid mobilization** by China could force difficult choices in a crisis, especially if combined with external distractions or shifts in the regional balance of power.
- **External shocks**, such as intensified US-China rivalry or regional instability (including in Pakistan), could unexpectedly trigger or amplify crises.

The most likely scenario through 2035 is a continuation of the existing pattern: cycles of tension, periodic border skirmishes, and managed competition without escalation to full-scale war. Powerful deterrents—nuclear, economic, and diplomatic—constrain both sides, while historical inertia favors crisis management over military escalation. Nonetheless, the potential for rapid escalation remains present due to unresolved disputes, proxy dynamics, and the risk of miscalculation in a complex regional security environment.

In sum, while the probability of a China-India war by 2035 is not negligible due to persistent flashpoints and intensifying strategic competition, powerful deterrents and a strong track record of crisis management make outright war significantly less likely than continued, occasionally volatile rivalry.
