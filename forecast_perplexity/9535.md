The United States is uniquely positioned with a permissive regulatory environment and a robust IVF industry, which could facilitate early adoption of embryo selection for intelligence. However, significant social, ethical, and technological barriers currently exist, preventing any country, including the US, from nearing the >10% threshold. The effectiveness and social acceptance of polygenic embryo selection technologies are crucial factors that will influence future adoption rates.

While the US has a favorable environment for technological advancement, the potential for significant social and political backlash could impede progress. Other countries, such as China, might surpass the US due to their rapid advancements in biotechnology and potentially more centralized decision-making processes, which could prioritize genetic enhancement.

For the US to be the first to reach the >10% threshold, it would need to maintain its technological leadership and see a shift in public opinion towards greater acceptance of genetic enhancement. This shift could be driven by perceived benefits and competitive pressures from other nations. The long time horizon until 2300 allows for considerable change, but the current status quo suggests that no country is close to achieving this milestone. Therefore, while the US is a strong candidate, the outcome remains uncertain due to the interplay of these complex factors.
