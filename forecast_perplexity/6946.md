Catastrophic anthropogenic disasters causing at least 10 million deaths are extraordinarily rare in the modern era, and neither China nor India has experienced such an event in recent decades. Historically, China stands out, having suffered several such tragedies in the 20th century, most notably the Great Leap Forward famine, which resulted from policy failures under a highly centralized political system. These historical episodes demonstrate that large-scale, unchecked policy errors in a centralized governance context can trigger disasters of immense scale. By contrast, India’s most severe anthropogenic disasters, such as the Bengal Famine and violence during Partition, have not reached this magnitude, and the country’s democratic system—with greater checks and balances—tends to mitigate the risk of single-point policy catastrophes.

In contemporary times, both countries remain exposed to a range of anthropogenic risks—industrial accidents, environmental mismanagement, and large-scale infrastructure failures. China’s ambitious infrastructure projects, including mega-dams like the one planned on the Brahmaputra, carry potential for catastrophic outcomes if systemic failures occur. Rapid industrialization and environmental degradation also accentuate the risk profile, especially where central decisions can affect vast populations in densely populated urban regions. India, with its growing and now slightly larger population, faces its own vulnerabilities: climate change impacts, strained water resources, rapid urbanization outpacing infrastructure, and cross-border tensions with China and Pakistan. Both countries have regional environmental risks that could, in extreme confluence with policy failures, amplify the scale of a disaster.

However, two powerful forces constrain the likelihood of either country reaching the 10 million death threshold from human-driven causes in the current era. First, both nations have significantly improved disaster preparedness, crisis management, and early warning systems, sharply reducing the probability of unchecked catastrophes escalating to historic levels. Second, the status quo bias is reinforced by the global decline in mass-fatality events due to better governance and technology. Even amidst geopolitical rivalries and environmental stressors, no current policy or trend in either country is on a trajectory likely to produce a disaster of this magnitude, and most recent crises have been regional and far smaller in scale.

Centralization in China theoretically allows both for rapid disaster response and, conversely, for errors to propagate widely if uncorrected. India’s decentralized, democratic governance, while slow to implement nationwide policy, builds systemic resistance to unchallenged catastrophic decisions. Demographic trends—India’s youthful, expanding population versus China’s aging, slightly declining population—create differing vulnerabilities, but both countries’ population exposure remains high enough that systemic failures could have devastating consequences, albeit no clear pathway currently exists for such escalation.

Exogenous, highly unpredictable “black swan” events—such as nuclear war, civil collapse, or deliberate mass violence—could theoretically drive death tolls past 10 million in either country, but the probability of such scenarios materializing in the near term remains remote.

In summary, while China’s historical track record and massive infrastructure ambitions create a marginally higher baseline risk for an anthropogenic catastrophe of this scale, advances in governance, risk management, and disaster response in both countries make any such event exceedingly unlikely in the foreseeable future. The most probable scenario is that neither China nor India will experience an anthropogenic disaster killing 10 million people before the other for decades to come.
