There is a long runway until January 1, 2300—over two centuries—for developments in polygenic embryo selection to unfold. At present, strict global regulations and in particular China’s cautious stance, especially in the wake of its 2018 incident, make it more likely that any early adoption of IQ‐focused selection will be slow and dispersed rather than concentrated in one country. China certainly possesses significant technical capabilities, a large and advanced fertility sector, and a history of pioneering breakthroughs, but its recent regulatory clampdowns and the broader international environment of stringent oversight together suggest that large-scale, overt production of IQ‐selected designer babies within its borders remains unlikely without major policy shifts or covert actions. Under current conditions, any early breakthroughs are expected to occur gradually, while regulatory and ethical constraints continue to favor a more internationally distributed set of developments. Only if China were to relax its restrictions significantly—or if clandestine practices were to become widespread—might it capture a majority of the first such cases. Given these factors, it is most plausible that early cases of IQ‐selected designer babies will be produced in various jurisdictions rather than predominantly in China.
