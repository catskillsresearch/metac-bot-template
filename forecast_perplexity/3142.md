There is a clear picture that, under current trends, the baseline—if no further missions occur—would reflect the historic record of 12 landings. However, ongoing and planned crewed missions are largely expected to add roughly six more successful lunar journeys, which aligns with expert sentiment placing the median outcome around 18 landings. This outlook is supported by broader expectations among analysts, who generally envisage a narrow range centered between 17 and 24, reflective of cautious optimism given the complexity of lunar exploration.

At the same time, significant uncertainties remain. On the one hand, technical challenges, budgetary constraints, or shifting political priorities could disrupt scheduled programs enough to delay or even cancel new missions; in such a scenario, the total might remain at the historical baseline. On the other hand, breakthroughs—whether through accelerated progress in national programs or through enhanced international and commercial collaboration—could lead to a series of rapid and successful landings, thereby pushing the cumulative total well beyond the median projection. 

Thus, while the prevailing expectation is that approximately 18 people will have landed by 2030 based on current trajectories, the outcome remains highly contingent on future developments in technology, funding, and international commitment to lunar exploration.
