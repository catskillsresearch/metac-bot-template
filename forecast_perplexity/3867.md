The modern landscape of global conflict is shaped by a combination of historical precedent, current geopolitical tensions, technological advances, and shifting alliances. The greatest risks for the start of a potential Third World War are concentrated within well-established flashpoints, particularly in Eurasia. These include Eastern Europe—specifically the Russia-Ukraine-NATO frontier (approximately 30–40°E); the Middle East, encompassing the Iran-Israel and Persian Gulf region (around 45–55°E); and East Asia, covering the Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait/South China Sea corridor (spanning approximately 110–130°E). 

Expert and market consensus has, for years, pointed to these regions as the most likely ignition points for a conflict of global scale, with ongoing crises and military buildups regularly drawing attention from analysts and policymakers. The probability of such a war remains estimated at about 10% before 2050, reflecting the influence of nuclear deterrence, multilayered alliances, economic interdependence, and the absence of direct great-power confrontation since 1945.

Modern warfare dynamics mean that an incident need not be a classic territorial invasion. Technological developments in cyber, space, and AI-driven warfare present new avenues for escalation, where the geographical attribution of an initiating incident could be ambiguous or even unexpected. For example, a large-scale cyberattack or technological sabotage emanating from the Western Hemisphere—such as North or South America (longitudes as far west as -120° to -70°)—could, in rare scenarios, provide the spark for multi-state escalation. Conversely, a sudden and severe confrontation in the far western Pacific—off the coasts of Japan or within the Sea of Japan (up to ~144°E)—could rapidly involve multiple G20 powers.

Despite these outlier possibilities, most expert analysis continues to situate the most likely starting longitude between Eastern Europe and East Asia. This corridor coincides with persisting regional conflicts, high military tensions, and overlapping spheres of influence among nuclear-armed states with global alliances. The inclusion of tail-risk scenarios acknowledges that black swan events—whether a proxy confrontation in Africa, an unexpected escalation in the Americas, or an entirely novel form of conflict—cannot be wholly discounted.

Critical drivers for any escalation include:

- Ongoing regional conflicts with risk of great-power involvement (notably in Ukraine, the Middle East, and the Taiwan Strait/Korean Peninsula).
- The potential for accidental or deliberate military escalation between alliances.
- The increasing salience of cyber and hybrid warfare, where attribution and initial impact may span continents.
- The presence of high-value resources, strategic chokepoints, and technological infrastructure.
- Historical precedents that show world wars can be triggered by localized incidents that spiral beyond initial participants.

Ultimately, while the future remains highly uncertain, and ambiguity persists if current trends of major-power peace continue, the most credible risk arc remains concentrated from the longitudes of Eastern Europe (~30°E) to East Asia (~130°E), with both lower and higher longitudes reserved for unpredictable and rare scenarios that could nevertheless meet the triggering criteria for a world war.
