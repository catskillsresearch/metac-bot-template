Pedro Sánchez, as of late May 2025, leads a minority coalition government in Spain, relying on support from the left-wing Sumar alliance and several regionalist and pro-independence parties. His government’s parliamentary base is fragmented, making sustained coalition management essential and at times precarious, especially during sensitive negotiations over budget passage and policy priorities such as defense spending and Catalan autonomy.

Despite frequent internal disputes, continuing public protests, and high-profile controversies—notably, the passage of the Catalan amnesty law—Sánchez has so far demonstrated notable political resilience and skill in navigating Spain’s complex political landscape. He has maintained coalition support through significant concessions, even amid persistent criticism from opposition parties and ongoing legal and political challenges.

Crucially, the architecture of Spain’s political system offers a structural advantage for incumbents between election cycles. There are no general elections scheduled until after 2025, removing the most common avenue for leadership change. The only mechanisms for Sánchez’s removal before year-end 2025 would be either voluntary resignation or a successful motion of no confidence. The latter requires an alternative majority in parliament—a high bar given current political fragmentation and the lack of a credible, unified opposition ready to govern. No such alternative majority appears to be forming, and the main opposition parties remain divided.

While coalition fragility remains a meaningful risk—exacerbated by unresolved disputes over budgets and policy priorities—historical precedent in Spain and current developments suggest that sudden government collapse via party defection or a scandal-driven resignation is relatively rare outside of election cycles. Sánchez continues to perform official duties and spearhead new initiatives, including crisis response and long-term planning for future elections. PSOE’s active preparation for the 2027 regional elections further signals expectations of continuity in leadership.

Thus, the default scenario is Sánchez retaining office through the end of 2025, as the procedural and political hurdles for his removal are formidable, and there is no clear sign of imminent coalition breakdown or coordinated alternative government. Still, risks associated with coalition instability, budget impasses, or sudden crises cannot be entirely discounted, and any dramatic, unforeseen event could swiftly alter the status quo. Considering institutional inertia, the lack of scheduled elections, Sánchez’s demonstrated political agility, and the opposition’s current inability to unite around a viable replacement, the prevailing dynamics strongly favor his continuation in office through December 2025.
