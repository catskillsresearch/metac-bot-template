The ketogenic diet is currently recognized as beneficial for specific populations, particularly those with refractory epilepsy and potentially subsets of individuals with obesity or metabolic syndrome. However, it does not enjoy the same broad acceptance as the Mediterranean diet for the general population due to ongoing concerns about long-term safety, cardiovascular risks, nutrient deficiencies, and sustainability. The scientific community is cautious and requires robust, long-term studies to shift consensus significantly. 

For the ketogenic diet to be widely accepted as both safe and beneficial for a significant population, new, compelling evidence must emerge. This would involve long-term studies demonstrating substantial health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health and metabolic markers, without significant adverse effects. Such evidence could lead to a consensus similar to that of the Mediterranean diet for specific populations, like those with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes.

Conversely, if new studies reveal significant health risks, such as increased cardiovascular disease or nutrient deficiencies, the diet could be deemed unsafe or lacking in benefits for any substantial population. Given the slow pace of change in scientific consensus and the current state of evidence, the likelihood of a major shift in perception by 2030 is moderate. The ketogenic diet is expected to remain beneficial for certain populations but is unlikely to achieve broad acceptance comparable to the Mediterranean diet without new, robust evidence.
