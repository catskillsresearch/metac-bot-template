The question of how many gene-edited babies will be born worldwide by the end of 2029 is influenced by several key factors. Currently, only two gene-edited babies, Lulu and Nana, are confirmed, and the timeline to determine the outcome is approximately 4.5 years. The status quo suggests that if no changes occur, the number will remain at two. However, the current trend, characterized by high regulatory barriers and intense scrutiny, indicates that the number is likely to remain very low, potentially in the single digits to low double digits by 2029.

Experts and markets generally expect the number of gene-edited babies to remain low unless there is a significant regulatory shift or technological breakthrough. This expectation is based on the current regulatory environment and the ethical concerns surrounding germline gene editing. A global consensus on a permanent ban or strict moratorium, with effective enforcement and severe penalties, could result in no additional gene-edited babies being born.

Conversely, an unexpected scenario could arise from a major technological breakthrough that makes germline gene editing safe, effective, and widely accepted. Such a breakthrough could lead to a rapid increase in the number of gene-edited babies, potentially reaching into the hundreds by 2029. This scenario might also involve a shift in public opinion and regulatory frameworks, allowing for more widespread application of the technology. Additionally, clandestine or unregulated clinics could emerge, operating undetected and contributing to an increase in the number of gene-edited births.
