The world GDP in 2028, measured in trillions of 2010 USD, will be influenced by several key factors and potential scenarios. Starting from a 2018 baseline of 80.078 trillion USD, the trajectory of global economic growth over the next few years will be critical in determining the final outcome.

If current trends continue, assuming an annual growth rate of approximately 3%, we could expect the world GDP to reach around 107.6 trillion USD by 2028. This aligns with most expert forecasts and market projections, which generally suggest a range of 105-110 trillion USD, with a central estimate of about 108 trillion USD.

However, several factors could significantly impact this projection. On the downside, there's a risk of a severe global recession. This could be triggered by a combination of escalating geopolitical tensions, a major financial crisis, prolonged supply chain disruptions, or even a new pandemic. Such events could lead to negative growth for multiple years, potentially pushing the world GDP as low as 90-95 trillion USD.

Conversely, there are also scenarios that could result in higher-than-expected growth. Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, clean energy technologies, and automation could drive a surge in productivity across multiple sectors. If coupled with successful global cooperation on trade and climate issues, this could lead to sustained higher growth rates. In an optimistic scenario, these factors could push the world GDP to 120 trillion USD or even higher.

It's important to note that the global economy is complex and subject to numerous unknowns. Unforeseen events, both positive and negative, could significantly alter the outcome. The impact of ongoing challenges such as climate change, demographic shifts, and technological disruptions will play crucial roles in shaping the economic landscape over the next few years.

Given these considerations, while a central estimate around 108 trillion USD seems reasonable, it's prudent to account for a wide range of possible outcomes when projecting the world GDP for 2028.
