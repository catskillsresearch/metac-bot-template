Demand for poultry meat has grown robustly over recent decades, and is expected to continue rising through 2030, driven by a combination of population growth, rising incomes, and shifting dietary preferences—especially in developing regions such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The FAO baseline from 2017 reported 70.95 billion poultry slaughtered worldwide, and static production at that level would result in 71 billion birds in 2030. However, this is considered highly unlikely given recent trends and authoritative projections.

Expert and organizational forecasts, principally from the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook, project global poultry meat production to reach 153 million tonnes by 2030, up from approximately 120–123 million tonnes in 2017—a rise of about 24–27% over this period. If the number of animals slaughtered tracks this volume growth proportionally, this implies a minimum of nearly 88–91 billion poultry slaughtered globally in 2030, assuming slaughter practices and average carcass weights remain relatively constant.

Numerous expert consensus forecasts, including those from professional forecasters and community prediction platforms, anticipate even higher numbers. Central estimates frequently cluster around 102 billion, with forecasts typically citing a range from 95 up to 116 billion birds slaughtered in 2030. This range reflects both continued robust demand and the increasing prevalence of poultry as a primary protein source, with projections indicating poultry will account for the highest absolute growth among all meat types and reach 41% of all meat-based proteins by 2030. The strongest production gains are expected in Asia and Central/South America, with North America and Europe still growing but losing share of global output.

Downside scenarios could include a global, persistent outbreak of avian influenza or a rapid and widespread adoption of alternative proteins due to health, environmental, or policy-driven shifts. Either could stall or even reverse upward trends, potentially reducing slaughter numbers to as low as 80–90 billion. Conversely, a high-end scenario could emerge if economic growth outpaces expectations in populous developing countries, technological and industrial efficiencies accelerate, and adoption of alternative proteins remains limited. Such conditions could push global poultry slaughter numbers to 115–120 billion or more.

In summary, the best-supported rationale is that robust growth in global poultry production will likely continue through 2030, increasingly centered in developing regions and supported by rising protein demand and advantageous production efficiencies. Expert expectations and institutional models, grounded in current demographic, economic, and consumption trends, point to an outcome range centered near 102 billion, with significant probability assigned to both higher and lower tails depending on the interplay of health, economic, and technological developments.
