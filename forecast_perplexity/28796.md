Rationale:

The development and adoption of SAE Level 5 autonomous vehicles by 2075 is a complex issue influenced by technological progress, regulatory frameworks, economic factors, and societal acceptance. While the current state of autonomous vehicle technology is far from Level 5, with most advanced systems operating at Level 4 in limited conditions, the long time horizon of over 50 years allows for significant advancements.

Ongoing investment and research by major tech and auto companies, coupled with the potential safety benefits and economic incentives for autonomous fleets in transportation and logistics, suggest a strong push towards higher levels of autonomy. The regulatory landscape is also evolving, with some countries and states creating frameworks for autonomous vehicle testing and deployment.

However, achieving true Level 5 autonomy, which requires operation in all conditions without any human intervention, remains a significant technological challenge. The jump from current Level 2-3 systems to Level 5 is substantial and may prove more difficult than anticipated. Safety concerns, regulatory hurdles, and public trust issues could slow widespread adoption.

Even if the technology is perfected well before 2075, factors such as consumer preferences, economic considerations, and the long lifespan of vehicles could prevent reaching the 95% threshold for new vehicle sales. There may still be niche markets, specific use cases, or consumer segments that prefer or require lower levels of autonomy. Additionally, the inclusion of all 4+ wheeled vehicles, not just passenger cars, in this forecast makes achieving the 95% mark more challenging.

The potential economic and safety benefits of full autonomy, including reduced accidents and increased productivity, could drive strong incentives for adoption. However, the extremely high threshold of 95% and the inclusion of all types of vehicles make a complete transition less likely.

Given the long time frame and the current trajectory of technological development, it seems more likely than not that Level 5 autonomy will be widely available by 2075. However, reaching the 95% threshold for new vehicle sales is less certain, as there may still be demand for human-controlled vehicles in certain situations or by enthusiasts.
