Advancements in synthetic biology and gene-editing technologies—including CRISPR-based systems—are rapidly transforming the landscape of biological risks. These powerful tools, originally intended for medical and industrial innovation, now present a dual-use dilemma, as the expertise, equipment, and genetic information needed to engineer or modify living organisms have become more broadly accessible and the technical barriers are steadily lowering. This democratization has shifted the potential for bioweapon development from exclusive state control to a wider pool that includes non-state actors and terrorist organizations.

New capabilities in synthetic biology enable the enhancement of pathogens for increased virulence, transmissibility, resistance to medical countermeasures, and immune evasion. Additionally, the combination of synthetic biology with emerging technologies such as AI and autonomous drones further amplifies operational risks: AI-driven design streamlines the creation of novel bioweapons or toxic compounds, while drones enable precision delivery and targeted dispersal over densely populated areas. These convergences mean that threats are not merely theoretical but increasingly plausible as real-world scenarios for both bioterrorism and unconventional warfare.

Despite the heightened risks, there are substantial barriers to the successful development and deployment of synthetic biological weapons on the scale defined by infecting at least 100 people. Engineering a pathogen that is both effective and reliably distinguishable from natural variants remains technically complex. The survival and stability of an engineered agent outside laboratory conditions, and the consistent production of novel, detectable symptoms, add further hurdles. Global biosecurity frameworks, such as the Biological Weapons Convention, while challenged by rapid scientific advancements and limited verification mechanisms, still provide governance and deterrence. Efforts to enhance surveillance and improve detection are ongoing, though these often lag behind technological progress.

Verification presents another significant challenge: For an event to qualify under the defined criteria, not only must the attack occur and cause widespread infection, but it must also be credibly attributed to a synthetic biological weapon through medical and forensic analysis and confirmed by authoritative sources. The incentives for concealment by perpetrators, as well as political and practical difficulties in attribution, make public confirmation unlikely in many plausible scenarios.

Historically, there have been no publicly confirmed cases of synthetic biological weapons causing large-scale infections. Yet expert consensus is that the threat environment is evolving: Accessibility to biotechnological tools is rising, AI is expanding capabilities, and both state and non-state actors are under greater incentive to explore bioweapon options. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the disruptive potential of novel pathogens, possibly increasing the attractiveness of bioweapons for those seeking asymmetric impact.

In sum, while the risk posed by synthetic biological weapons is escalating due to accelerating technological advances, expanded access, and emerging operational synergies, formidable technical, verification, and governance barriers remain. These factors result in a complex and evolving threat landscape in which the probability of a synthetic biological weapon infecting 100 people by 2030 is substantial—but still counterbalanced by robust biosecurity efforts and the considerable challenges involved in both execution and confirmation.
