# Smallpox Reemergence: Risk Assessment Through 2029

The risk of smallpox reemergence by 2029 requires careful analysis of historical precedent, current containment measures, and emerging risk factors. Since smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, the world has maintained a perfect record with no confirmed cases for nearly 47 years, representing one of humanity's greatest public health achievements.

## Historical Context and Containment

Smallpox was officially declared eradicated by the World Health Organization in May 1980 following a successful global vaccination campaign. Since then, the variola virus has been maintained in only two authorized laboratories: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA, and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) in Koltsovo, Russia. These facilities have operated under strict international oversight, with regular WHO inspections and research protocols.

The eradication of smallpox marked a turning point in our relationship with pathogens. Unlike previous failed attempts to eradicate diseases like hookworm, malaria, and yellow fever, smallpox was uniquely vulnerable to eradication because the virus has only one host - humans - and there was an effective vaccine against it.

## Emerging Risk Factors

Several recent developments have moderately increased the risk profile for smallpox reemergence:

**US Withdrawal from WHO Oversight**

On January 20, 2025, the United States began the formal process of withdrawing from the WHO via executive order. This unprecedented situation creates uncertainty regarding oversight of one of only two facilities authorized to possess and conduct research with smallpox virus. Key questions raised by this withdrawal include whether the US will:
- Continue to undergo standard biennial inspections by WHO's Biosafety Inspection Team
- Follow the established oversight program through WHO's Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research
- Report research results through standard WHO processes
- Maintain smallpox virus at only one location (CDC Atlanta)

This withdrawal could potentially lead to "unprecedented and dangerous changes" relating to smallpox virus storage, experiments, reporting, and inspections.

**Advances in Synthetic Biology**

Technological advances have created another pathway for potential smallpox reemergence. In 2017, researchers demonstrated that it was possible to construct an infectious horsepox virus from chemically synthesized DNA fragments for approximately $100,000, suggesting similar techniques could potentially be applied to smallpox. While still technically challenging, this represents a feasible route for reconstruction by a sufficiently resourced and determined actor.

**Waning Population Immunity**

The United States ceased routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972, meaning most Americans under 53 years old are not protected. This creates a large vulnerable population should any exposure occur. Globally, immunity levels are at their lowest point in decades, creating conditions where even a single case could spread rapidly before containment measures are implemented.

## Mitigating Factors

Despite these concerns, several factors continue to work against smallpox reemergence:

**Technical Challenges and Detection Capabilities**

While synthetic biology has advanced, creating a functional smallpox virus remains significantly more challenging than demonstrated with horsepox, requiring specialized knowledge and resources. Additionally, surveillance for poxvirus cases has improved, especially given heightened concern about pox-like diseases such as mpox, making it highly likely that even a single smallpox case would be rapidly detected and reported.

**Continued Biosecurity Interest**

Even while withdrawing from WHO, the US maintains strong incentives to prevent smallpox reemergence. A 2024 report emphasized the need for the United States to strengthen its ability to respond if smallpox resurfaces, noting that "the threat of smallpox cases in the future is nonzero" and that "even one case would be a public health emergency". This suggests ongoing commitment to biosecurity protocols despite changes in international engagement.

**International Vigilance**

The catastrophic consequences of a smallpox release ensure that both security and research communities maintain vigilance against accidental or deliberate release. The second repository in Russia remains under WHO inspection and oversight, creating redundant safety systems.

## Potential Pathways to Reemergence

The most plausible routes to smallpox reappearance include:

1. An accidental laboratory release from one of the official repositories, potentially exacerbated by lapses in oversight following the US withdrawal from WHO protocols.

2. A deliberate act using existing stocks or a synthetically reconstructed virus, taking advantage of advances in DNA synthesis technology and potentially reduced oversight.

3. Successful de novo synthesis and introduction of variola virus by a sufficiently resourced actor, using techniques similar to those demonstrated for horsepox.

## Risk Assessment

The status quo of zero smallpox cases has been maintained for nearly half a century, demonstrating remarkable resilience across various geopolitical tensions and technological developments. While new risk factors have emerged, particularly the US withdrawal from WHO oversight and advances in synthetic biology, these represent incremental rather than revolutionary changes to the risk landscape.

The probability of another confirmed smallpox case by the end of 2029 has increased from what it was a decade ago but remains low. The most likely pathways would be through a laboratory accident following reduced oversight, a deliberate synthesis using advanced biotechnology, or potentially a deliberate release from an undisclosed sample.

Given the continued operation of containment protocols, the technical challenges involved in virus synthesis, and the strong incentives for prevention across all nations, the likelihood of smallpox reemergence by 2029 remains very low, but can no longer be considered negligible.
