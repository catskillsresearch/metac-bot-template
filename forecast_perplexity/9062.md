A plausible view is that once a weak AGI is developed, the period until a superintelligent AI emerges is likely to be on the order of 18 to 24 months. In this scenario, incremental progress and existing engineering practices lead to a moderate takeoff, where recursive self-improvement occurs at a steady rate and experts generally anticipate a transition period in that range. This expectation is shaped by assessments of current research trends and historical patterns in technological breakthroughs.

At the same time, there are reasons to consider that this interval could be significantly shorter or longer. On the shorter end, if the initially developed AGI possesses formidable recursive self-improvement capabilities and is able to quickly optimize and rewrite its own architecture, the resulting intelligence explosion could occur in a matter of days or even weeks—a near-immediate transition to superintelligence. Conversely, if technical challenges, regulatory constraints, or the need for substantial hardware and architectural overhauls come into play, the process could be markedly protracted, potentially stretching the gap to several years—or even up to a decade in the most extreme safety-conscious scenario.

This range of possibilities reflects the inherent uncertainty in predicting such a transformative event, where the resolution of the outcome will only become clear once a weak AGI is publicly recognized and its subsequent behavior unfolds. Overall, while the most likely scenario points to a transition on the order of 18 to 24 months, the potential exists for both rapid acceleration and prolonged development, underscoring the importance of considering both the optimistic and cautionary factors in estimating the timeline for superintelligence after AGI.
