## Rationale for the Likelihood of Over 34 Countries Committing to a Stringent Anti-Solar-Geoengineering Pact Before 2026

Current international momentum is building toward the restriction of solar geoengineering, with substantial advocacy from civil society, academic communities, and a number of governments and regional blocs. Calls for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering—incorporating strict prohibitions on deployment, experiments, funding, patenting, and international support—are gaining increasing attention globally, as exemplified by endorsements from more than 2,000 organizations and over 500 academics across 50+ countries.

**Political and Regional Developments**

Distinct regional blocs have articulated strong support for restrictive measures. The African Ministerial Conference on the Environment and the European Parliament have explicitly called for a non-use mechanism, while Pacific Island nations such as Vanuatu and Fiji have also advocated for firm restrictions. Germany has shown interest in pursuing dialogue, and the European Union has supported the Africa Group’s restrictive stance during negotiations at the United Nations Environment Assembly.

**Civil Society and Precedent Frameworks**

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has, since 2010, maintained a *de facto* moratorium on geoengineering, and recent reaffirmations in 2024 reinforce a foundation for further restrictive governance. Nearly 2,000 civil society organizations have endorsed such measures, aligning advocacy across continents and providing a degree of political legitimacy to non-use campaigns.

**Barriers and Historical Precedents**

Despite these developments, major obstacles inhibit the rapid formation and ratification of a comprehensive, stringent anti-solar-geoengineering treaty by 35 or more countries within the short seven-month window remaining before 2026. International environmental treaties of similar ambition—such as the Paris Agreement or the Minamata Convention—typically require years of negotiation, drafting, and domestic ratification even when facing high urgency and widespread consensus.

Recent diplomatic efforts at the UN have stalled, failing even to achieve consensus on less restrictive regulatory proposals, let alone the five strict criteria required for the proposed agreement. Key provisions, especially bans on research funding and patent rights, are contentious. Some influential states continue to fund or consider solar geoengineering research and may resist blanket prohibitions, particularly in light of ongoing international debate and the U.S. government’s significant investment in solar geoengineering research. Patent restrictions present a complex legal challenge, intersecting with established intellectual property regimes that move slowly and are typically resistant to sweeping reforms within compressed timeframes.

**Institutional and Diplomatic Realities**

Formally negotiating, concluding, and ratifying a stringent treaty by more than 34 countries involves a series of demanding steps: finalizing treaty text, convening international conferences for signature, and navigating diverse domestic ratification processes. This complex, sequential process historically takes years, not months—even for less contentious and more widely supported agreements. While some countries may make strong political statements or preliminary commitments, these fall short of the robust, binding obligations required by the question.

**Geopolitical and Practical Constraints**

The current international climate features competing diplomatic agendas and prominent climate negotiations, such as preparations for COP30 and the ongoing process around countries' updated NDCs. These priorities, alongside the deeply divided positions among major powers regarding solar geoengineering research and deployment, further diminish the likelihood of rapidly coalescing the requisite level of support.

**Conclusion**

In summary, while the trajectory for a stringent anti-solar-geoengineering pact enjoys growing momentum—reflected in advocacy, political statements, and renewed interest in precautionary governance—entrenched diplomatic, legal, and procedural barriers make it highly improbable that more than 34 countries will have formally committed to an agreement meeting all five stringent criteria before 2026. The most realistic outcome is continued progress in advocacy and policy development, with any eventual binding agreement likely to materialize after the current resolution date.
