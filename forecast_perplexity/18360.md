The release of GPT-5 is anticipated, but as of now, it has not occurred, leaving the 30-day window for any AGI claims by OpenAI yet to begin. Historically, OpenAI has demonstrated a cautious approach towards declaring any of its models as AGI, and there is no substantial evidence to suggest a deviation from this pattern with GPT-5. The prevailing expectation is that OpenAI will continue to highlight the model's capabilities and limitations without labeling it as AGI. This approach is likely influenced by the current regulatory and competitive landscape, which may discourage bold claims without substantial justification.

However, there remains a possibility that significant advancements in GPT-5's capabilities or strategic considerations could prompt OpenAI to assert that the model has achieved AGI. Such a decision might be driven by a breakthrough that aligns with OpenAI's internal criteria for AGI or a strategic move to position itself against competitors. Despite this, the subjective nature of AGI definitions and the potential repercussions of making such a claim suggest that OpenAI will likely maintain its cautious stance. Therefore, while the potential for a significant breakthrough cannot be entirely dismissed, the likelihood of OpenAI claiming GPT-5 as AGI within 30 days of its release remains low.
