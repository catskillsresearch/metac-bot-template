A significant increase in NATO’s defense spending target is now highly likely at the June 2025 summit, driven by a convergence of transatlantic political momentum, security imperatives, and US pressure. The current 2% of GDP target is widely viewed as inadequate in light of heightened threat perceptions—especially following Russia’s continued aggression in Ukraine—and internal Alliance reviews consistently emphasize the need to address substantial capability gaps and ensure credible deterrence.

The United States, led by President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is pressing for a headline target of 5% of GDP in defense-related spending across the Alliance. However, while this proposal has shaped the public debate and set a high bar, it is universally recognized as politically and economically unattainable for most European NATO members in the near term. The resulting negotiations have coalesced around a compromise framework, widely credited to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte: a two-tier approach specifying a 3.5% of GDP minimum for traditional defense spending by 2032, supplemented by an additional 1.5% goal for broader security-related areas such as cybersecurity, infrastructure, and societal resilience.

Key European powers, especially Germany and France, have endorsed this 3.5% + 1.5% compromise as both realistic and ambitious—balancing US demands for greater contributions with the political and fiscal realities facing their economies. The structure enables the US administration to declare partial victory while offering member states flexibility and a credible pathway to phase in increased commitments over several years. NATO’s own spokesperson has stated the Alliance recognizes 2% as “not nearly enough,” and that the upcoming summit will focus on “ambitious” new targets to strengthen core military capabilities and invest in broader resilience.

Practical considerations reinforce the momentum toward a 3.5% floor. The US is already on track to meet this new threshold in fiscal year 2026, and the Heritage Foundation and other security experts have called the 3.5% target a substantial and necessary “downpayment” toward Alliance readiness, urging regular progress reviews and accountability mechanisms. While a small group of member states—especially those with weaker economies or traditionally lower defense spending—may struggle with the higher bar and advocate for softer language or longer implementation timelines, the prevailing diplomatic and policy signals point to an Alliance-wide floor of 3.5% as the most attainable consensus.

Although the summit could witness last-minute surprises—such as political crises, deadlock, or a push for a more moderate figure—the near-unanimous assessment among officials, media, and external analysts is that the minimum threshold will rise markedly above the status quo. The ultimate agreement is expected to formalize 3.5% of GDP for core defense spending as the binding minimum target, likely accompanied by an aspirational 5% benchmark when broader security investments are included. This compromise both acknowledges ongoing US pressure and reflects the collective recognition that enhanced and accountable defense spending is essential to maintaining credible deterrence and Alliance cohesion in the coming decade.
