# Rationale: Global "Religiously Unaffiliated" Population Projection for 2050

The most comprehensive demographic projections from Pew Research Center and other scholarly sources indicate that the percentage of the global population identifying as "religiously unaffiliated" will decline from approximately 16% in 2010 to around 13.2% by 2050. This projection reflects a decrease in relative share despite an expected growth in absolute numbers from about 1.1 billion to over 1.2 billion unaffiliated individuals worldwide.

## Demographic Drivers

The primary forces behind this projected decline are demographic in nature:

- **Fertility Gap**: The Total Fertility Rate for religiously affiliated women (2.59 children per woman) is nearly a full child higher than for unaffiliated women (1.65 children per woman).
- **Age Structure Differences**: The median age of religiously affiliated women is six years younger than unaffiliated women, creating a substantial demographic advantage for religious growth.
- **Population Distribution**: The unaffiliated population is heavily concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region (76% in 2010, projected to be 68% in 2050), making demographic trends in this region particularly influential on global percentages.

## Regional Variations

While the global percentage is projected to decline, regional trends show significant variations:

- **North America**: The unaffiliated population is expected to nearly double by 2050 (89% growth), far outpacing the region's overall population growth of 26%.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: The unaffiliated population is projected to grow by 92%, though this is less than the region's expected overall growth of 131%.
- **Europe**: The share of global unaffiliated residing in Europe is expected to increase slightly from 12% to 13%.
- **Latin America**: The unaffiliated population is projected to grow by 44%, exceeding the region's overall growth rate.

## Religious Switching Effects

Religious switching patterns will influence but not dramatically alter the demographic trajectory:

- The unaffiliated are expected to gain approximately 61 million people through net switching by 2050 (gaining 97 million while losing 36 million).
- Christians are projected to experience the largest net losses from switching, with about 106 million leaving versus 40 million joining, with most former Christians joining the unaffiliated category.
- Even with increased rates of switching to unaffiliated status, demographic models suggest the percentage would not exceed approximately 14.3% by 2050.
- With decreased switching or increased religious retention, the figure could fall closer to 12.2%.

## Potential Alternative Scenarios

Several factors could push the outcome higher or lower than the baseline projection:

**Lower Outcome Scenarios (11-12%)**:
- A significant religious revival in China, which currently has a large share of the world's unaffiliated population
- Increased religious retention or fertility rates among affiliated populations
- Cultural or geopolitical pressures favoring religious identification
- Slower rates of secularization than currently projected in developing regions

**Higher Outcome Scenarios (14-16%)**:
- Widespread, rapid secularization in currently religious countries, particularly populous nations like India
- Accelerated economic development and educational advances leading to unexpected secularization in Africa or the Islamic world
- Major shifts in China's religious landscape toward greater unaffiliated identification
- Global social movements or crises that significantly erode religious affiliations

Despite these potential variations, the demographic momentum behind the baseline projection is substantial. Even significant changes in religious switching patterns would only modestly alter the projected outcome due to the overwhelming influence of differential fertility rates and age structures between affiliated and unaffiliated populations.
