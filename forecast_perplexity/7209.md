The current regulatory environment in the United States focuses on compliance and oversight rather than criminalizing the possession of Bitcoin. Presently, there are no laws that criminalize mere possession, and the status quo suggests that this is unlikely to change without significant catalysts. Bitcoin has achieved substantial institutional adoption, making outright criminalization both politically and economically challenging. Constitutional considerations regarding property rights would also pose legal challenges to any attempt to criminalize possession.

The regulatory focus remains on compliance measures such as anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) requirements, tax compliance, and consumer protection. These measures aim to regulate transactions and prevent illegal activities without targeting possession itself. Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a legitimate asset class and is integrated into the financial system, further reducing the likelihood of criminalization.

However, the long timeframe until 2060 allows for potential shifts in policy due to unforeseen circumstances. A significant shift in the political or economic landscape could lead to heightened concerns about national security, monetary sovereignty, or financial stability. In such scenarios, the US government might consider criminalizing Bitcoin possession to protect its financial system or national interests. Historical precedents, such as the gold prohibition, demonstrate that drastic measures are possible but typically require extraordinary circumstances and substantial justification.

Despite these possibilities, the probability of a conviction for mere possession remains low given the current trajectory and the slow pace of legal changes. Regulatory changes tend to be incremental and focused on compliance rather than outright prohibition, making the status quo outcome the most likely scenario.
