The time frame until the resolution of this question is approximately 75 years, with the outcome to be determined by the year 2100. Currently, the prevailing scientific consensus favors natural explanations for interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, and there is a significant evidentiary threshold for national space agencies to declare an object as having a non-human artificial origin. The status quo, if unchanged, suggests that no such conclusion will be reached by any national space agency.

A scenario leading to a "No" outcome involves the continued discovery of interstellar objects that, despite potentially unusual characteristics, are consistently explained through natural astrophysical processes. The scientific community and space agencies are likely to maintain a conservative approach, requiring extraordinary evidence for any claims of artificial origin, which is not currently met. As detection capabilities improve, more data will likely support comprehensive natural formation theories, further reducing interest in artificial origin hypotheses.

Conversely, a "Yes" outcome would require the discovery of interstellar objects with characteristics that cannot be explained by natural processes. These might include regular geometric patterns, non-natural material composition, or technological signatures. Such evidence would need to be overwhelming, corroborated by multiple lines of inquiry, and withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny. Only then could at least two national space agencies reach a consensus on an artificial origin.

Given the current trajectory of scientific understanding and the high evidentiary threshold required for such an extraordinary claim, the status quo outcome is heavily favored. The scientific community's inclination towards natural explanations and the institutional conservatism of space agencies further support a low probability of a "Yes" outcome. However, the long timeframe until 2100 allows for the possibility of significant advancements in detection and analysis technologies, which could potentially lead to new insights. Despite this, the slow pace of change in scientific consensus and the rigorous standards of evidence required suggest that the likelihood of finding conclusive evidence of non-human artificial origin remains low.
