# Biotechnology and Bioengineered Organisms as Potential Sources of Global Catastrophe

The risk of a catastrophic biological event is growing due to several converging factors that make biotechnology an increasingly plausible source of global catastrophe by 2100. While no historical precedent exists for a biological event causing 10% global population decline within a 5-year period, the technological landscape is evolving rapidly.

## Accelerating Technological Capabilities

The biotechnology sector is experiencing unprecedented growth and transformation:

- The global bioinformatics market is projected to reach approximately $39.4 billion by 2033, growing at nearly 12% annually, indicating massive investment in computational tools that facilitate biological research and engineering.

- Gene synthesis and editing technologies are becoming more accessible, affordable, and powerful, lowering barriers to creating novel or modified organisms.

- The convergence of AI and biotechnology is creating powerful new capabilities. As noted in the WEF Global Risks Report 2025, biotech is "supercharged by AI" creating potentially "low-probability, high-impact risks" including "biological terrorism" and "adverse outcomes from frontier technologies."

This technological acceleration means that creating pathogens with combinations of traits rarely found together in nature—extreme transmissibility, high lethality, and resistance to countermeasures—becomes increasingly feasible over time.

## Governance Challenges and Geopolitical Factors

Current governance structures face significant challenges in mitigating these growing risks:

- The Biological Weapons Convention lacks robust verification mechanisms, and increasing capabilities worldwide make monitoring difficult.

- Political tensions between major powers could undermine international cooperation on biosecurity, as evidenced by recent developments such as funding cuts to scientific research and accusations about gain-of-function research.

- The competitive race between nations (particularly the US and China) in biotechnology creates potential security risks, with concerns about countries potentially taking shortcuts in safety protocols to gain strategic advantages.

- Regulatory frameworks struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancement, creating uncertainty about permissible research and appropriate oversight.

## Risk Pathways and Probability Factors

A biotechnology-driven catastrophe could materialize through several pathways:

**Deliberate misuse**: State actors or terrorist groups could develop and deploy engineered biological agents as weapons. While no evidence suggests current state bioweapon programs aim to create global catastrophic agents, geopolitical instability could change incentives over the 75-year timeframe.

**Accidental release**: The expansion of high-containment laboratories globally increases the statistical probability of accidents. Expert estimates suggest an annual probability of 0.002% to 0.1% for a global pandemic resulting from an accident with certain types of pathogen research in the US alone, with global estimates potentially reaching 0.016% to 0.8% annually. Over 75 years, these cumulative probabilities become non-trivial.

**Ecological disruption**: Large-scale gene drive deployments or other biotechnological interventions could have unforeseen effects on ecosystems, potentially triggering cascading failures affecting food systems or other critical infrastructure.

## Balancing Factors

Several factors suggest caution in assigning too high a probability:

1. Despite concerning trends, no global catastrophe of this magnitude has occurred in recorded history, including from natural pandemics.

2. International awareness of biosecurity risks continues to grow, with increasing resources devoted to prevention.

3. Defensive technologies (vaccines, antivirals, diagnostics) are advancing alongside offensive capabilities.

4. Most researchers and institutions have strong incentives to maintain safety and prevent catastrophic accidents.

5. Creating a pathogen with the perfect combination of high transmissibility, lethality, and resistance to countermeasures remains technically challenging, even with advancing capabilities.

## Long-Term Outlook

Given the 75-year timeframe to 2100, the cumulative risk becomes substantial. The subtle but relentless increase in capability, global knowledge diffusion, and geopolitical instability makes a catastrophic accident or misuse increasingly plausible over time.

If a global biological catastrophe occurs, it would likely be due to an engineered pathogen that combines unprecedented transmissibility, lethality, and treatment resistance—traits that would be exceptionally rare in naturally occurring organisms. Such an agent could either be deliberately deployed as a bioweapon or accidentally released from research facilities.

The long time horizon, democratization of biotechnology capabilities, and integration of AI with biological research suggest that while the absolute annual probability remains low, the risk is substantial and growing over the century timeframe.
