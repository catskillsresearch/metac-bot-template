There are roughly four and a half years until the end of 2029, a period during which the many ongoing legal cases must resolve. Historically, no former U.S. president has ever received a custodial sentence, and legal processes involving high-profile political figures tend to be protracted and fraught with delays—including lengthy appeals and procedural hurdles—that often result in noncustodial outcomes such as fines, probation, or dismissals. Moreover, the political and judicial systems have exhibited a tendency toward maintaining the status quo in cases involving such notable individuals, while Trump’s continued political influence may further contribute to outcomes that steer clear of extended jail time. 

Nonetheless, an alternative scenario remains plausible, albeit less likely: should there be a dramatic shift in the legal landscape—such as the emergence of overwhelming evidence combined with a political environment that is decisively inclined toward accountability—the legal process could proceed with sufficient speed and resolve to impose a custodial sentence of at least 30 days before the deadline. 

Taking into account historical precedent, the typical pace of legal proceedings in politically charged cases, and the current state of the investigations, the balance of evidence suggests that a prolonged custodial sentence before 2030 remains unlikely.
