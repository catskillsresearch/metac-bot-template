Nvidia’s stock performance heading into the end of 2025 is shaped by a confluence of bullish fundamentals, strong sector momentum, and persistent—but manageable—risks. As of late May 2025, Nvidia trades just above the threshold required to close the year higher than it started, with only a minimal increase needed to secure a “Yes” outcome.

The company’s leadership in artificial intelligence continues to underpin robust demand for its chips, as global tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft maintain heavy investments in AI infrastructure. This has translated into exceptional financial results: Nvidia’s fiscal 2025 revenue leapt by 114% year-over-year to $130.5 billion, accompanied by a 147% increase in GAAP earnings per share. The successful scaling and commercialization of the Blackwell AI chip family, which achieved rapid, large-scale adoption, further reinforces Nvidia’s position at the center of the AI hardware ecosystem.

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia’s prospects. The consensus year-end price targets range from $150 to $164, a substantial premium over the year’s starting price and well above the required threshold. Even the most conservative reputable forecasts, such as 24/7 Wall St.’s $135.58, are marginally above the bar for a positive outcome. Technical strength is evident as well, with the stock trading above both its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, signaling continued positive momentum.

However, risks are present and cannot be dismissed. Heightened volatility in the technology sector during 2025 has at times weighed on Nvidia’s share price, and valuation multiples remain elevated, prompting some analysts to warn of potential downside if growth moderates or if broader market sentiment turns negative. Key headwinds include further restrictions on exports to China—which could materially impact revenue from Nvidia’s H20 chips—as well as intensifying competition in the AI chip market and potential market corrections driven by macroeconomic factors like rising interest rates or shifts in sector rotation.

Recent positive developments, such as easing US-China trade tensions and ongoing strength in AI-related demand, have produced notable rebounds in Nvidia’s share price, demonstrating the stock’s sensitivity to both external news flow and market sentiment.

With just over seven months remaining in the year, the proximity of the current price to the threshold, the company’s dominant position in AI, resilient earnings growth, bullish analyst consensus, and favorable technicals all combine to make a positive outcome more likely than not. While vigilance around key risks is essential, the underlying momentum and breadth of support for Nvidia suggest that a modest gain by year-end—enough to finish higher than it started—remains the most probable scenario.
