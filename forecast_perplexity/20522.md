The Trump administration has fundamentally shifted U.S. AI governance by prioritizing deregulation and private-sector innovation over federal reporting mandates for AI foundation models. In January 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14179, which explicitly revoked the comprehensive AI foundation model reporting requirements established by Biden’s Executive Order 14110. This move fulfilled a campaign promise and set the tone for an administration focused on removing regulatory barriers to AI development, enhancing American leadership and competitiveness, and treating AI primarily as a national security and economic asset rather than a risk requiring broad regulatory oversight.

Subsequent policy actions have reinforced this deregulatory stance. Official communications, including memoranda from the White House Office of Management & Budget, have shifted the focus of federal AI governance to agency procurement, risk management, and government use—deliberately excluding private-sector reporting requirements. No new federal regulations or executive orders matching the scope of EO 14110’s foundation model reporting regime have been enacted, and the administration’s ongoing AI Action Plan, developed in consultation with the National Science Foundation, shows no indication of reviving such mandates.

Legislative developments further support this trajectory. The House-passed "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" imposes a 10-year moratorium on state and local regulation of AI systems, signaling bipartisan support for a broad deregulatory approach at both federal and state levels. Legislative and regulatory efforts since January 2025 have focused on targeted issues, such as deepfake harms, rather than sweeping industry-wide reporting requirements for AI developers.

The administration’s philosophy centers on enabling rapid innovation to maintain an edge over geopolitical competitors like China, reducing perceived regulatory obstacles, and addressing risks through narrow, issue-specific interventions rather than through comprehensive transparency or reporting mandates. There is a consensus among policymakers that regulation, if necessary, should be minimal and directly tied to national security, not as a blanket requirement for all dual-use model development.

While it remains theoretically possible that a major AI incident or an abrupt shift in Congressional priorities could prompt reinstatement of reporting requirements, there is currently no substantive movement toward such a reversal. No bills in Congress, regulatory proposals, or policy statements indicate momentum for restoring or replacing EO 14110’s reporting regime. The default scenario, barring highly unusual developments, is the continued absence of federal reporting requirements for dual-use foundation AI models at the end of 2025.

In summary, the explicit revocation of prior reporting requirements, combined with a sustained deregulatory agenda at both the executive and legislative levels, the prioritization of innovation and U.S. competitiveness, and the lack of signals suggesting policy reversal, strongly indicate that federal reporting requirements for AI foundation models will not be in place in the U.S. at the end of 2025.
