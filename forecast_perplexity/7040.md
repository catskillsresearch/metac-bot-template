Wheat de‐allergenization remains an area of active research, with current work—largely focused on gene editing methods such as CRISPR—producing promising, yet only partial, reductions in allergenic proteins like alpha‐gliadins. Existing approaches have achieved notable progress in reducing these proteins, but the challenge lies in overcoming the inherent genetic redundancy of wheat and ensuring that the modifications do not compromise the crop’s essential qualities. The observable status quo is one of incremental improvement, where partial reductions are common, yet complete de‐allergenization (defined as reducing allergenic protein levels to below 10% of the usual amount with demonstrable clinical benefits) has not been realized in a manner that satisfies rigorous peer‐reviewed criteria.

A successful outcome before the deadline would likely require a breakthrough—perhaps through refined CRISPR techniques or another innovative strategy—that not only definitively targets multiple allergenic gene families but also preserves wheat’s agronomic characteristics. This breakthrough would need to be supported by robust clinical data showing a statistically significant reduction in immune response, culminating in a peer‐reviewed publication or an approved market product.

Conversely, if research continues along its present path without a decisive leap forward, technical complexities, regulatory hurdles, or unintended impacts on wheat quality could prevent achieving the rigorous de‐allergenization standards in time. Given the historical pattern of gradual change in crop biotechnology and the challenges specific to manipulating a complex genome like that of wheat, there is a substantial risk that the progress will remain incremental rather than revolutionary.

Thus, while the potential for a breakthrough exists and transformative advancements could shift current trends, the prevailing evidence suggests that significant obstacles still stand in the way of fully de‐allergenized wheat by the target date.
