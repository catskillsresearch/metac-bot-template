# Rationale: Will at least three lithium mines operate in the US before 2030?

## Current Landscape of US Lithium Production

As of mid-2025, the United States has only one fully operational lithium mine - Albemarle's Silver Peak in Nevada's Clayton Valley. This facility has been the country's sole domestic source of lithium for years, producing around 900 tonnes annually, which represents approximately 1% of global lithium output. This single-mine status represents a significant vulnerability in America's critical mineral supply chain, with over 98% of US lithium materials currently being imported from overseas suppliers.

## Advanced Projects Poised to Change the Landscape

Several major lithium mining projects are now in advanced stages of development across the United States:

### Thacker Pass (Nevada)

Located in northern Nevada's Humboldt County, Thacker Pass represents a watershed moment in America's push for domestic critical mineral production. This project is structured as a strategic joint venture between Lithium Americas Corp. and automotive giant General Motors. Construction has officially begun, with the first significant construction milestone achieved in May 2025 when permanent concrete was placed in the processing plant area. The project is well-financed, having secured a $2.26 billion loan from the Department of Energy, and is projected to be operational by late 2027.

The mine sits atop one of the largest known lithium clay deposits globally, with estimated reserves sufficient to support operations for 40+ years. When operational, Thacker Pass is expected to produce approximately 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate annually.

### Rhyolite Ridge (Nevada)

This enormous lithium mine in the Nevada desert was granted final government approval in October 2024. Australian operator Ioneer has stated that operations at Rhyolite Ridge will produce enough lithium to supply batteries for more than 370,000 electric vehicles every year. The company's managing director, Bernard Rowe, confirmed that construction would begin in 2025, stating: "This permit gives us a license to commence construction in 2025 and begin our work in creating hundreds of good-paying rural jobs, generating millions in tax revenue for Esmeralda County, and bolstering the domestic production of critical minerals."

### Kings Mountain (North Carolina)

Albemarle, which already operates the Silver Peak mine, is developing the Kings Mountain lithium mine in North Carolina. The company estimates that Kings Mountain will be operational between 2025 and 2030. This project has received support from the Department of Defense, which has entered an agreement with Albemarle to expand domestic lithium mining for US battery supply chains.

## Government Support and Strategic Importance

The US government has demonstrated strong commitment to developing domestic lithium production through both policy support and financial investment. This push is driven by several factors:

1. **National security concerns**: Reducing dependency on foreign suppliers of critical minerals has become a strategic priority.
2. **Growing demand for electric vehicles**: The EV revolution requires substantial lithium supplies.
3. **Economic development**: These projects promise hundreds of good-paying jobs in rural areas.

The Department of Defense's agreement with Albemarle demonstrates the government's ongoing commitment to securing domestic lithium supplies. Similarly, the Department of Energy's massive loan to the Thacker Pass project underscores the federal priority placed on establishing domestic production.

## Potential Challenges and Risk Factors

Despite the positive momentum, several challenges could potentially delay these projects:

1. **Regulatory hurdles**: While Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge have received key approvals, implementation delays are common in mining projects.
2. **Environmental and community opposition**: Mining projects often face resistance from local communities and environmental groups, particularly near Native American lands.
3. **Technical challenges**: Large-scale mining operations frequently encounter technical difficulties during construction and initial operations.
4. **Market volatility**: Lithium prices have experienced significant fluctuations, which could impact project timelines if economic conditions change.

## Timeline Assessment

The evidence strongly suggests that at least three lithium mines will be operational in the US before 2030:

1. **Silver Peak**: Already operational and seeking a 25% expansion.
2. **Thacker Pass**: Under active construction with concrete placement occurring in May 2025, targeting operation by late 2027.
3. **Rhyolite Ridge**: Final government approval received, with construction planned for 2025.
4. **Kings Mountain**: Projected to become operational between 2025-2030.

Even accounting for typical delays in mining projects, the advanced stage of these developments—with construction already underway at Thacker Pass and imminent at Rhyolite Ridge—suggests a high probability of success. The strategic importance of these projects for national security and the energy transition further increases the likelihood that they will overcome potential obstacles.

The timeline for these projects appears realistic given their current status. Thacker Pass has moved beyond initial planning and permitting into actual construction, while Rhyolite Ridge has cleared its most significant regulatory hurdle. Kings Mountain benefits from Albemarle's existing operational experience at Silver Peak and has received federal support.

Given that major construction is already underway at Thacker Pass, government approval has been granted for Rhyolite Ridge with construction planned for 2025, and multiple other projects are in advanced stages, it is highly likely that at least three lithium mines will be operating in the US before 2030.
