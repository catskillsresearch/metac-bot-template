A critical evaluation of the situation in Gaza City heading toward August 31, 2025, centers on several intertwined military, political, and humanitarian dynamics shaping the balance of power.

**Military and Political Context**

Since the collapse of the January 2025 ceasefire, Israeli forces have dramatically intensified military operations across Gaza, including Gaza City. The current campaign—codenamed "Gideon's Chariots"—has brought about widespread destruction, significant casualties, and mass displacement. By late May 2025, Israeli forces reportedly control approximately 81% of the Gaza Strip via direct military occupation or enforced evacuation orders. Israeli leadership, particularly Prime Minister Netanyahu and senior ministers, has outlined a clear intent not only to defeat Hamas militarily but to establish lasting control over the territory, emphasizing demilitarization and long-term security oversight.

**Status of Hamas and Other Local Actors**

Hamas’s governance and fighting capacity have been severely degraded. Key leaders, including Mohammed Sinwar (after his brother Yahya Sinwar’s earlier death), have been killed, and remaining command structures have suffered crippling blows. Despite this, remnants of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continue to mount resistance in urban pockets, contributing to the ongoing contestation of power, particularly within the densely populated urban environment of Gaza City. Nevertheless, the organization’s ability to function as a coherent governing authority is close to exhausted.

**Urban Warfare and the Contest for Control**

Despite Israel’s overwhelming military advantage and the sweeping occupation of territory, complete and uncontested control in urban environments is historically difficult to achieve. Urban resistance, administrative breakdown, and the destruction of infrastructure leave room for continued contestation—meaning that, even in the face of military superiority, a security vacuum or sporadic insurgency could prevent any one actor from exercising effective day-to-day administration of Gaza City by the end of August 2025.

**International and Humanitarian Factors**

The humanitarian situation is dire, with no aid having entered Gaza for over ten weeks by late May, catapulting the population toward famine and compounding displacement. International pressure on Israel has escalated, with Western states suspending trade talks, imposing sanctions, and condemning extended Israeli operations in Gaza. While these efforts have yet to force an operational change, the possibility remains that a sudden spike in global diplomatic or domestic political pressure—possibly driven by the humanitarian catastrophe—could induce an Israeli policy shift, potentially paving the way for an internationally administered authority or a technical, PA-led transitional government. However, such a transition would face major logistical and political barriers in the short timeline remaining until August 31.

**Viability of Alternative Governance Scenarios**

Discussions of alternative governance, including an international trusteeship or American-led interim administration, have occurred between the US and Israel, but lack concrete implementation. Israel continues to reject both PA/Fatah and international control, and shared power is essentially excluded due to the uncompromising positions of all principal actors.

**Outlook and Possibilities**

Given these dynamics:
- The most likely trajectory is the continued expansion and consolidation of Israeli military control over Gaza City, with a strong likelihood of Israel exercising de facto authority by August 31, 2025.
- There remains a real, though secondary, chance of the city being contested—where no party has effective, unified control—due to the persistent challenges of urban warfare, resistance, administrative breakdown, and humanitarian crisis.
- Scenarios involving a rapid political deal introducing PA/Fatah or international administration are lower probability, requiring dramatic and coordinated intervention from external actors and rapid implementation in a context that currently lacks both consensus and logistics for such a shift.
- The chance of Hamas maintaining or regaining de facto power is extremely low given the scale of leadership losses, sustained military pressure, and current inability to govern or provide services.

**Conclusion**

The eventual configuration of power in Gaza City by late summer 2025 is most convincingly shaped by Israel’s overwhelming military campaign, stated ambition for lasting control, and the absence of practical alternative authorities. However, the possibility that Gaza City will remain contested—without a single clear power—should not be dismissed, owing to the difficulties of urban pacification, persistent resistance, and the unpredictable impact of international and humanitarian crises. All other outcomes require sudden, large-scale diplomatic changes that, while conceivable, are not presently materializing.
