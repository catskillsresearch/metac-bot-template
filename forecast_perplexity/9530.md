South Korea’s fertility rate trajectory toward 2032 is shaped by the interplay of recent policy shifts, demographic headwinds, and evolving social attitudes. The country experienced an unprecedented decline in its total fertility rate (TFR) over the past two decades, dropping below 1.0 in 2019 and reaching a historic low of 0.72 in 2023. A modest rebound was observed in 2024, with the TFR rising to 0.75, largely attributed to a post-pandemic surge in marriages, intensified government pronatalist policies, and corporate family-friendly initiatives. This uptick is the first positive movement after nearly a decade of declines, sparking debate over whether it signals an inflection point or a temporary reversal.

Government efforts are substantial, including robust financial incentives for marriage and childbearing, improved parental leave benefits, and strategic campaigns such as the "Family 10 Years" period. These measures are intended to stem the demographic crisis, with official projections—such as those from Statistics Korea—offering a medium scenario where the TFR rises to 1.0 by 2031, and a high scenario envisioning 1.40 by 2045. However, most independent demographers are skeptical that these initiatives will achieve their ambitious targets, highlighting persistent structural barriers: skyrocketing housing costs, intense competition in education and employment, entrenched gender inequalities in both the workplace and domestic spheres, and the ongoing decline in the population of women of childbearing age.

The consensus among experts is that while short-term stabilization or incremental increases in TFR are possible, especially if existing policy efforts are sustained or strengthened, the long-term outlook remains constrained by deep-rooted societal and economic challenges. The most likely scenario for 2032 is a TFR in the range of 0.7–0.9, with a moderate chance of reaching around 1.0 if reforms and incentives prove unusually effective and cultural attitudes shift more rapidly than currently anticipated.

Downside risks persist. Should South Korea experience another economic crisis, a renewed housing affordability crunch, or a surge in social pessimism, the TFR could fall further, potentially dipping into the 0.5–0.6 range—an outcome consistent with the more pessimistic official projections and global demographic precedents under severe stress. Conversely, any unexpected, broad-based transformation—such as a substantial improvement in work-life balance, dramatic reductions in living costs, or a major shift in norms surrounding marriage and family formation—could drive the TFR closer to, or even slightly above, 1.0 by 2032. However, such an outcome would require a degree of societal and policy innovation not yet visible at scale.

In summary, South Korea’s fertility prospects to 2032 are defined by persistent ultra-low fertility, possible modest recovery driven by policy and social shifts, but limited by enduring demographic and economic headwinds. The system remains highly sensitive to shocks, both negative and positive, but the baseline expectation is continued fertility rates well below replacement, with only cautious optimism for significant improvement.
