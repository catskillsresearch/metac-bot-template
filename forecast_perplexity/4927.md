SpaceX's valuation as of 2024 is approximately $360 billion. If the company maintains its current trajectory, particularly with the growth of Starlink and the successful deployment of Starship, its valuation could be in the range of $250 billion to $350 billion by 2030. Expert projections and market analyses generally support this range, with some optimistic scenarios suggesting valuations could reach $500 billion to $700 billion if Starlink and other ventures significantly exceed expectations.

However, there are potential challenges that could impact this growth. A significant regulatory hurdle or technical failure with Starlink or Starship could severely limit SpaceX's growth, resulting in a valuation closer to $100 billion to $200 billion. Additionally, increased competition from other satellite internet providers or a downturn in the global economy could negatively impact SpaceX's valuation.

On the other hand, if SpaceX successfully commercializes interplanetary transport with Starship and Starlink achieves unprecedented global market penetration, the company's valuation could soar to $500 billion to $700 billion. Furthermore, if SpaceX becomes a leader in emerging space markets such as space mining or in-space manufacturing, this could further boost its valuation.
