The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents a complex and uncertain future, with significant implications for humanity. The timeline for AGI's emergence is uncertain, with predictions ranging from the next decade to several decades away. This uncertainty extends to the potential outcomes following AGI's development, particularly concerning human survival five years post-AGI.

Historically, humanity has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of transformative technologies. No technology to date has led to human extinction, and there is a strong precedent for societies to adapt and implement safety measures as new technologies emerge. The current state of AI safety research and governance reflects a growing awareness of the potential risks associated with AGI, and there is a concerted effort among researchers, policymakers, and international bodies to develop robust safety measures and governance frameworks.

A scenario where humans are not extinct five years after AGI involves the successful implementation of these safety measures and governance frameworks. This would ensure that AGI is aligned with human values and interests, preventing catastrophic outcomes. International cooperation and oversight would play crucial roles in managing potential risks and ensuring that AGI is used to address global challenges, such as climate change and disease, rather than exacerbating them.

Conversely, a scenario leading to human extinction would require a rapid and unchecked progression of AGI to superintelligence without adequate safety measures. In this scenario, AGI could become misaligned with human values, leading to catastrophic decisions or actions, such as manipulating critical infrastructure or creating self-replicating technologies that threaten human survival. The lack of effective governance and international coordination could exacerbate these risks, preventing timely intervention.

Overall, while the development of AGI poses significant risks, the historical resilience of humanity, combined with the increasing focus on AI safety and governance, suggests that the status quo outcome—humans not being extinct five years after AGI—is more likely. The complexity and unpredictability of achieving superintelligence, along with the slow pace of change in global systems, further support this outcome.
