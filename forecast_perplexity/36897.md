Kemi Badenoch’s leadership faces acute and escalating challenges rooted in historic electoral setbacks, catastrophic polling numbers, and visible, organized internal dissent within the Conservative Party. The party’s recent trajectory has been shaped by the aftermath of its worst defeat in modern history, subsequent devastating local election losses (over 600 seats and 13 councils), and polling that now places it behind Reform UK, with Badenoch’s own favorability collapsing to 17% and a net approval of -32—the worst for any Conservative leader in this polling series. This profound unpopularity not only undermines morale across party ranks but has also led senior figures, party chairmen, and shadow cabinet members to publicly question or outright call for her resignation, amplifying the sense of crisis.

The mechanics for triggering a leadership challenge in this parliament are notably more accessible due to the party’s diminished size (121 MPs), which lowers the number of letters needed to initiate a 1922 Committee confidence vote to about 18—a threshold that is arguably easier to reach than in previous situations. Unlike in larger parliaments, even a relatively small bloc of disgruntled MPs can quickly organize an official challenge. Reports indicate that MPs are not only plotting but have also begun preparing media strategies to apply further public pressure, with bookmakers and analysts now widely viewing a challenge as “inevitable” if present trends persist.

Historical precedent weighs heavily: Conservative leaders suffering comparable electoral and polling collapses—Theresa May, Iain Duncan Smith, and others—have typically faced, and often lost, organized confidence votes or have been compelled to resign within a year of crisis onset. The Conservative Party’s established pattern is to move swiftly to remove leaders perceived as liabilities, especially when there is a collective fear of terminal decline.

Nevertheless, inertia remains a real force. The party is fractured, with no universally accepted successor—though figures like Robert Jenrick are gathering some support. Donors are divided, and organizational fatigue after consecutive crises can slow the momentum needed for successful internal revolts. The summer parliamentary recess may also introduce a practical delay, providing Badenoch with a brief respite from weekly scrutiny and buying her limited time to attempt tactical adjustments or to benefit from divisions among rivals.

Badenoch herself has publicly dismissed calls for her resignation as “not serious” and shows little sign of voluntarily stepping aside. Leaders commonly attempt to ride out discontent until directly confronted by a critical mass of MPs or a decisive procedural move. However, as public and private plotting intensifies, and with polling and morale showing no signs of recovery, the likelihood of top-down inertia overcoming the centrifugal forces of public dissent and party panic appears increasingly slim.

Ultimately, while organizational paralysis, lack of consensus on a successor, or a desire to postpone turmoil until after the autumn conference could grant Badenoch short-term survival, the combination of:

- unprecedented and sustained electoral and polling collapse,
- highly public intra-party plotting and open discontent,
- the mechanically easier threshold for challenge,
- and the party’s tradition of rapid leadership turnover in crisis,

all tilt the balance heavily toward a leadership contest or resignation before September 2025. If the party fails to act, it would represent an unusual break from its historic “regicidal” norms in the face of existential threat.
