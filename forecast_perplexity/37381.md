# Rationale for the NYC Mayoral Primary Margin of Victory

With just 27 days until the June 24, 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor, the race has consolidated into primarily a two-person contest between former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Assembly Member Zohran Mamdani. The dynamics of this race are particularly noteworthy as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, facing significant vulnerabilities including a dismissed criminal indictment and disqualification from the public matching funds system, has opted to run as an independent in November rather than compete in the Democratic primary.

## Current Polling Landscape

The most comprehensive polling data comes from the Marist poll conducted in early May 2025, which showed Cuomo with a substantial lead in the final round of ranked-choice voting - 53% compared to Mamdani's 29%, representing a 24-point margin of victory. However, more recent internal polling from the Mamdani campaign indicates a narrowing race, with Cuomo at 56% and Mamdani at 44% - a 12-point margin. While internal campaign polls should be viewed with some skepticism, this trend suggests Mamdani is gaining ground, albeit still trailing significantly.

Political analysts from the Honan Strategy Group have characterized this as "truly a 2-person race" between Cuomo and Mamdani, with some even suggesting that "the ball game appears to be over before the first pitch is even thrown" - indicating an expected comfortable Cuomo victory. Nevertheless, Mamdani's campaign believes he still has room to grow given his lower name recognition compared to Cuomo and substantial campaign funds remaining.

## Key Factors That Could Influence the Final Margin

**Ranked-Choice Voting Dynamics**: New York City's ranked-choice voting system adds complexity to forecasting. As lower-performing candidates are eliminated, their voters' second and third choices will significantly impact the final margin between Cuomo and Mamdani.

**Late Campaign Developments**: With nearly four weeks remaining until the primary, there's still time for significant campaign developments that could shift support patterns. Debates, high-profile endorsements, and advertising blitzes could all impact the final margin.

**Turnout Patterns**: Differential turnout among demographic groups could substantially impact the final margin. Current polling shows Cuomo with strong support across various demographic groups, particularly among older voters who typically have higher turnout rates. A surge in progressive voter turnout or unexpectedly low turnout in Cuomo strongholds could narrow the gap.

**Consolidation of Support**: Several other candidates besides Cuomo and Mamdani collectively represent a significant portion of the vote. How their supporters rank their choices - and whether any remaining candidates drop out to endorse either frontrunner - will impact the final margin.

## Possible Scenarios

If current trends hold steady, Cuomo would likely defeat Mamdani by approximately 12-15 percentage points. However, several scenarios could alter this expected outcome:

**Narrower Margin Scenario**: A major scandal involving Cuomo emerges in the final
