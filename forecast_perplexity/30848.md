# Netanyahu's Prospects for Remaining Prime Minister Throughout 2025

As of late May 2025, Benjamin Netanyahu continues to serve as Israel's Prime Minister with no immediate signs of resignation or removal. With just over seven months remaining until the end of the year, several factors will determine whether he completes 2025 in office.

## Political Landscape and Coalition Stability

Netanyahu's political position faces significant challenges, though he has repeatedly demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout his career. Recent polling shows his coalition would receive only 48 seats in the 120-seat Knesset if elections were held today - the lowest level since early 2025. This declining popularity follows ongoing war-related challenges and failures to rescue captives from Gaza.

The coalition recently navigated a critical hurdle by passing the 2025 budget in late April, which averted automatic dissolution and immediate elections. However, underlying tensions persist, particularly around the ultra-Orthodox conscription issue following a June 2024 Supreme Court ruling requiring their service. Netanyahu has promised to enlist 10,500 ultra-Orthodox Jews over the next two years, creating significant strain within his coalition.

When asked about potential elections during a recent press conference, Netanyahu deflected: "Do you want elections now? Is that what we need — a commission of inquiry right now — when all our soldiers and commanders will be running around dressing up as lawyers instead of arming themselves with artillery shells and tank munitions?" He argued that "in the middle of a war" is not the time for political disruption.

## Legal Framework and Challenges

Israeli law provides significant protection for sitting prime ministers, requiring a final conviction with all appeals exhausted before mandatory removal. Netanyahu continues to face corruption trials and international legal scrutiny, including an ICC arrest warrant issued in November 2024. However, none of these proceedings appear likely to conclude with final convictions within the 2025 timeframe.

## International Relations

Netanyahu's relationship with the United States under President Trump appears complex. While there have been reports of tensions, Netanyahu recently stated: "A few days ago — I think around 10 days ago, maybe a little more — I spoke on the phone with President Trump. And he said to me, literally: 'Bibi, I want you to know — I have absolute commitment to you. I have absolute commitment to the State of Israel.'"

Netanyahu has also reported reassurances from Vice President Vance, who allegedly told him: "Listen, don't pay attention to all this fake news about this rupture between us… It's all spin. This isn't the truth, you know it's not true, and I'm telling you, from our side, it's not true."

## Potential Scenarios

For Netanyahu to remain Prime Minister throughout 2025, he would need to:
- Maintain coalition stability despite internal tensions
- Avoid conviction with all appeals exhausted in his ongoing legal cases
- Prevent a successful no-confidence vote
- Remain healthy and able to perform his duties (without an absence exceeding 30 days)

Scenarios that could end his tenure include:
- Coalition collapse over contentious issues like ultra-Orthodox conscription
- A sudden health crisis removing him from office for more than 30 days
- An unexpected acceleration of legal proceedings leading to final conviction
- Resignation due to overwhelming political pressure

## Weighing the Factors

The incumbency advantage and legal protections favor Netanyahu remaining in office. Despite public dissatisfaction and coalition vulnerabilities, there is currently no active parliamentary mechanism threatening his immediate removal. The ongoing war provides him with a national security justification for maintaining leadership stability.

However, Israeli coalition politics are historically volatile, and the combination of declining popularity, legal jeopardy, and internal tensions creates significant downside risk. While Netanyahu has weathered numerous political storms throughout his career, the current challenges represent a substantial test of his political survival skills.

Given these considerations, while the status quo favors Netanyahu completing 2025 as Prime Minister, the probability is only moderately high, reflecting the genuine risks to his continued tenure.
