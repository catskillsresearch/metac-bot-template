With eight days remaining until the June 3, 2025 South Korean presidential election, polling and political analysis indicate a volatile but still decisive lead for Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party over Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party. The most recent reputable national surveys show Lee ahead by approximately 7–9 percentage points, with support rates typically in the mid-to-high 40% range for Lee and upper 30s for Kim, while third-party candidate Lee Jun-seok holds around 10% of the vote share. 

This margin has notably narrowed in recent weeks: earlier in May, Lee’s lead stood at double digits, reaching as high as 22 points in some surveys, but has compressed to high single digits as conservative support has rallied and centrist voters have migrated towards the Reform Party’s Lee Jun-seok. The final week could see further tightening if current trends continue, plausibly reducing the margin to the 5–7 percentage point range. This convergence is attributed both to growing certainty among voters and sustained, energetic campaigning by Kim and Lee Jun-seok, particularly among young, right-leaning, and centrist demographics. 

Expert and market consensus remains that Lee Jae-myung will win, but without the overwhelming margin that some earlier polls suggested. Analysts and political insiders generally anticipate a margin in the 7–10 percentage point range, though some Democratic Party officials have floated the possibility of a margin shrinking below 5%, in line with recent tightening and to keep their base mobilized. Betting markets and political observers also reflect this reduced, but clear, advantage for Lee.

Several factors inject significant uncertainty into the race. The ongoing failure of conservative merger negotiations means Lee Jun-seok’s Reform Party candidacy continues to split the opposition vote. However, scenarios in which conservatives rapidly unify—via a late informal alliance or a strategic withdrawal—could substantially narrow the margin, especially if turnout among “shy” conservative voters is undercounted by public polls. Conversely, should Lee Jun-seok’s support diminish further and his voters shift disproportionately toward Lee Jae-myung, or if a major negative event hits the Kim Moon-soo campaign in the final days, Lee could achieve a margin exceeding 12–13 points, approaching landslide territory. 

Historical context tempers expectations of either extreme. While the 2022 presidential election was decided by less than one point, the current environment—shaped by the fallout from former president Yoon’s impeachment and the Democratic Party’s strong showing in the April 2024 legislative elections—favors a somewhat larger, but still competitive, margin for the ruling party. Recent polls have occasionally been misrepresented on social media, but the consensus in professional polling and analysis remains that Lee’s lead is real and persistent, though vulnerable to last-minute shifts in voter sentiment and late-campaign events. 

Overall, the range of plausible outcomes for the margin of victory is wide, owing to potential vote-splitting, late consolidations, turnout unpredictability, and possible campaign shocks. The most likely scenarios foresee a Lee Jae-myung victory with a margin somewhere between 5 and 10 percentage points, but credible paths exist both for a much narrower contest—should conservatives unexpectedly unify or a last-minute scandal erupt—and for a double-digit win, should the opposition remain fractured or turnout heavily favor the ruling party.
