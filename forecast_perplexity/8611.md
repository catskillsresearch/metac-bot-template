A comprehensive assessment of the prospects for a China-Russia war by 2035 rests on several key factors rooted in their recent history, evolving strategic partnership, areas of friction, and the deterrent effects of nuclear arsenals.

The prevailing dynamic between China and Russia is characterized by a robust and institutionalized strategic partnership, underpinned by formal treaties such as the 2001 Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and subsequent agreements reaffirming mutual cooperation. Both countries have resolved longstanding border disputes and have since focused on expanding political, economic, and military collaboration. Regular high-level meetings, joint military exercises, and increasing levels of bilateral trade and technological cooperation reinforce their commitment to this partnership.

A central driver of this alignment is their shared interest in counterbalancing Western influence—particularly from the United States and its allies—in global and regional affairs. This external strategic pressure has continuously incentivized both Moscow and Beijing to deepen cooperation, rather than risk destabilizing their relationship through direct confrontation. Joint military exercises, such as those held in 2024, are designed to demonstrate unity and deter external adversaries, not to prepare for bilateral conflict.

While the partnership is strong, it is not without latent tensions. Russian anxieties about China's rising economic and demographic influence in Central Asia and the Russian Far East, as well as increasing asymmetry in the relationship—with China emerging as the clear senior partner—are noted sources of unease. Competition for influence in third regions, such as the Middle East and the Arctic, also presents potential friction points. However, these disagreements have consistently been managed through diplomatic channels and pragmatic arrangements, with no escalation to military crises.

Expert surveys and future scenarios consistently predict that, by 2035, the world order will likely feature China and Russia in the same geopolitical bloc, possibly with closer formal alliance structures. Major areas of global conflict are more likely to be flashpoints involving the US and its partners, while China-Russia conflict is widely judged to be highly improbable by relevant analysts.

A critical constraint against the outbreak of large-scale war is mutual nuclear deterrence. Both states possess extensive nuclear arsenals, and the risks associated with direct major-power war serve as powerful disincentives to escalation. The threshold for what constitutes “war” in this context—1,000 or more battle-related deaths in a single year—would require a dramatic breakdown of the current cooperative framework, an eventuality for which there is little precedent or current indication.

Disruptive “wild card” events—such as sudden regime change, severe leadership crises, or accidental border incidents—cannot be wholly discounted. However, the existing inertia of their established relationship, high-level institutional ties, and the overwhelming costs associated with conflict make a shift to direct war exceedingly unlikely without a fundamental and unforeseeable strategic realignment.

In summary, while low-probability, high-impact events are an intrinsic part of geopolitical forecasting, the weight of the evidence—the depth of current cooperation, the alignment of external interests, the management of internal frictions, and the nuclear deterrent—indicates an extremely low likelihood of a China-Russia war by 2035. The status quo incentive structure remains overwhelmingly tilted toward continued partnership and conflict avoidance.
