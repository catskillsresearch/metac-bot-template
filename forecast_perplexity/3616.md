The United States has a long history of extremely slow constitutional change, largely due to the steep procedural hurdles involved. Any new amendment must first overcome high thresholds in Congress—typically requiring a two‐thirds supermajority in both houses—and then gain ratification by a significant majority of the states. This difficult process has been compounded in recent decades by persistent partisan polarization and legislative gridlock, making it unlikely for proposals to achieve the broad consensus needed.

Historically, amendments have only passed when an extraordinary national crisis or a dramatic political realignment galvanized both major parties and a wide array of state governments. Without such a pivotal moment, the status quo has consistently precluded major changes, even when contentious issues like campaign finance reform or adjustments to executive term limits have been on the table.

In essence, while it is not impossible for a widely appealing and urgent reform to break through entrenched political divisions, the prevailing political environment—with its deep-seated polarization and the inertia characteristic of constitutional processes—strongly favors the continuation of current trends. Unless an unprecedented political shift occurs to generate rare, broad-based support, the structural and historical challenges are likely to keep the amendment process stalled.
