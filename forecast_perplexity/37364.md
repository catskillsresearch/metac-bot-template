## Rationale

Tariffs have become a central fixture of global economic and political reporting in 2025, consistently dominating the front pages of both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. This persistent coverage is directly tied to the ongoing trade disputes involving the United States, particularly President Trump's aggressive tariff threats and the high-profile negotiations with the European Union, China, Vietnam, and other key trading partners. The most prominent current development is the postponement of a 50% US tariff on EU goods until July 9, keeping the topic at the forefront of international news and market analysis throughout the entire window in question.

Both newspapers have a strong editorial and business incentive to report on tariff developments. Their audiences are heavily invested in trade, economic policy, and international market movements, meaning that any tariff-related announcements, threats, delays, negotiations, or market reactions have direct and ongoing news value. The coverage is further reinforced by the fact that tariffs directly influence global markets, cause significant economic volatility, and are a primary lever of US foreign policy at this time. Historical precedent shows that once issues like tariffs become a central policy tool and a focus of public debate, coverage remains robust until there is a clear and lasting resolution—something not currently on the horizon.

The structure of the news cycle and the expansive definition of "front page" (which includes summary business news and even secondary headlines) substantially reduce the likelihood that tariffs could be omitted from both major papers on the same day. The only real scenario where tariff mentions could disappear simultaneously from both front pages would require a globally dominating, non-economic crisis—such as a catastrophic natural disaster, an outbreak of war, or an unforeseen, all-consuming political event. Even then, the threshold for displacing trade news is extraordinarily high, given the imminent July 9 deadline and the strategic importance of tariffs in current US policy.

As it stands, ongoing trade negotiations and the daily unpredictability of policy announcements make "tariff" a near-constant presence. Unless an extreme, unexpected global event completely monopolizes the news cycle—something for which there is currently no indication—tariffs will almost certainly continue to appear daily on at least one, if not both, front pages through June 2025. The combination of sticky policy relevance, economic impact, editorial incentives, and timing of scheduled tariff actions all but guarantees that coverage will persist uninterrupted.
