The percentage of American adults identifying as LGBTQ in 2070 will likely be influenced by a complex interplay of social, cultural, and technological factors over the next 45 years. Currently, about 9.3% of American adults identify as LGBTQ, but this figure has been steadily increasing in recent years.

If the current trend were to continue linearly, we might see percentages as high as 20-25% by 2070. However, this linear extrapolation is likely unrealistic, as social trends often follow more complex patterns. Most experts anticipate continued growth in LGBTQ identification, but at a decelerating rate, with estimates generally ranging from 12% to 18% by 2070.

Several factors could contribute to an increase in LGBTQ identification:

1. Continued social acceptance and normalization of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.
2. Advancements in gender-affirming technologies and treatments, making it easier for individuals to transition or express their gender identity.
3. Expansion of gender and sexual identity categories, providing more nuanced ways for people to describe their experiences.
4. Ongoing influence of social media and online communities in facilitating self-discovery and expression.

However, there are also potential factors that could limit or reverse this trend:

1. A cultural backlash against LGBTQ+ identities, possibly coupled with more conservative policies.
2. Technological changes that reduce the influence of social media on identity formation.
3. A plateau effect as social acceptance reaches a saturation point.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly impact the outcome. A dramatic shift towards complete societal embrace of fluid gender and sexual identities could push the percentage much higher, potentially reaching 30-35%. Conversely, a significant cultural backlash and reduced social acceptance could lower the percentage to around 8-10%.

Given the long time horizon and the potential for unforeseen societal changes, it's prudent to consider a wide range of possible outcomes. The lower bound of plausible outcomes might be around 8%, representing a scenario with limited growth or even some regression from current levels. The upper bound could extend to 25% or higher, reflecting a continued strong trend of increasing LGBTQ identification.
