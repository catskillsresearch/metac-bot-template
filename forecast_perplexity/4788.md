The likelihood of artificial superintelligence (ASI) preceding the achievement of longevity escape velocity (LEV) by 2300 hinges on several key factors shaping the trajectories of both fields.

**Differential Progress and Technical Bottlenecks**

Artificial intelligence has been advancing at a steady and sometimes exponential rate due to improvements in algorithms, data availability, and especially computational power. The development process for AI fundamentally benefits from short iteration cycles: new models and techniques can be tested, refined, and deployed within days or months, significantly accelerating progress. Investment and global talent are heavily concentrated in AI research, with private and public funding vastly outpacing that dedicated to anti-aging efforts. These scaling effects and resource flows create a fertile environment for breakthroughs and rapid improvement.

In contrast, the pathway to longevity escape velocity involves surmounting the immense complexity of human biology. Progress in anti-aging technologies depends not only on scientific discoveries but also on overcoming lengthy and expensive clinical trials, navigating rigorous regulatory environments, and addressing ethical as well as societal concerns. The strict criterion for LEV—demonstrating that more than half of 70-year-olds treated with a therapy live for an additional 50 years—means that even after a breakthrough therapy is developed, decades of follow-up are required before its efficacy can be confirmed. This inherently long feedback loop in biology slows down the pace of validation and implementation.

**Status Quo and Mainstream Forecasts**

Historically, transformative technological changes in both AI and longevity have happened more slowly than early, optimistic forecasts suggest. As of 2025, neither milestone has been reached. Most mainstream expert assessments and aggregated forecasting platforms agree that AGI and subsequently ASI are plausible this century, with some consensus placing the arrival of ASI within years or even months after AGI is achieved. By contrast, the mainstream biomedical community remains skeptical that LEV is within reach over the coming decades, viewing near-term radical life extension as speculative and dependent on a series of unknown breakthroughs.

**Interaction and Acceleration Effects**

While it is possible that early forms of superintelligent AI could directly accelerate biomedical research—and thus bring LEV closer—this would still mean ASI arrives first. The enabling technologies in AI have the potential to unlock solutions to complex biological problems, but the reverse is unlikely: progress in longevity is not expected to be a significant driver or enabler for the emergence of ASI.

**Uncertainty, Black Swans, and Societal Factors**

Both fields remain exposed to deep uncertainties, including the potential for unexpected scientific or societal developments. Unanticipated breakthroughs in biology—such as revolutionary gene editing or nanotechnologies—could conceivably speed progress toward LEV. Conversely, societal resistance or regulatory barriers could stall AI progress. However, the structural advantages of AI—its reliance on digital infrastructure, rapid scalability, measurable progress, and clearer objectives—make it less vulnerable to the inertia and unpredictabilities that hamper biomedical innovation.

**Comparative Synthesis**

In sum, the feedback cycles, technical feasibility, resource allocation, and prevailing expert opinion all align to suggest that, if either transformative milestone is realized by 2300, ASI is substantially more likely to arrive first. The development of superintelligent AI is characterized by faster iteration, stronger scaling effects, and fewer complex bottlenecks than the challenge of achieving and rigorously validating true longevity escape velocity in humans. Thus, the current balance of evidence and structural factors positions ASI as the most probable predecessor to LEV within the specified timeframe.
