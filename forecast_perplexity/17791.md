Ukraine has repeatedly emphasized its dependence on Western security guarantees, notably via NATO membership, as the principal alternative to pursuing a nuclear weapons program in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. President Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian leaders have used explicit nuclear rhetoric—positioning nuclear rearmament and NATO integration as parallel security options—to communicate both their frustration with the inadequacy of current guarantees and to pressure Western partners for more effective support. Despite this rhetoric, Ukrainian officials and ministries have consistently reaffirmed their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and have denied any active nuclear weapons program or plans to initiate one. 

Ukraine has the technical expertise, civilian nuclear infrastructure, access to uranium, and delivery system know-how that could in theory enable a nuclear program, and some Ukrainian sources have suggested rapid mobilization would be possible if ordered. However, independent experts generally assess that while Ukraine could potentially begin developing nuclear weapons in a crisis, actually fielding an operational arsenal would almost certainly require years rather than months, particularly given ongoing war conditions, substantial logistical and financial hurdles, and international monitoring.

The biggest disincentive for Ukraine to pursue nuclear weapons remains its profound reliance on Western and EU military, economic, and diplomatic support. Initiating a nuclear weapons program would almost certainly trigger immediate and severe consequences: loss of Western aid, potential international sanctions, and intensified Russian threats or military escalation. These penalties would undermine Ukraine’s survival prospects in the ongoing conflict and undercut its aspirations for deeper integration with Western institutions.

Recent developments, like provocative Russian missile launches and the continued erosion of trust in international security guarantees, have heightened Ukrainian security anxieties but have not produced any credible evidence—via official statements, international agency reports, or major media coverage—of Ukraine launching a systematic nuclear weapons program as of late May 2025. Instead, Ukraine is seeking expanded long-term defense commitments from the EU and maintaining active cooperation with Western military and diplomatic partners.

Rhetorical references to nuclear rearmament thus remain a form of strategic signaling rather than a shift in policy. The likelihood of Ukraine actually launching a nuclear weapons program before January 2026 is contingent on a dramatic security shock—such as a catastrophic collapse in Western support or an existential act of aggression by Russia—none of which has transpired as of the current date. Institutional inertia, the high risks and costs of nuclear breakout, and the short timeframe remaining reinforce the expectation that Ukraine will not pursue a nuclear weapons program by the end of 2025.
