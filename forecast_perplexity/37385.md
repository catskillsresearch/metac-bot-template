# Trump's Net Approval on Inflation: June 2025 Forecast

With 28 days remaining until June 25, 2025, I'll analyze Donald Trump's likely net approval rating on inflation according to the Silver Bulletin tracking data, examining current trends and potential developments over the next month.

## Current Inflation Approval Status

President Trump is currently performing poorly on inflation metrics. Recent polling data paints a consistent picture:

- Trump is significantly "underwater" on inflation, with his net approval (approve minus disapprove percentage) deeply in negative territory
- Polling from The Hill shows 66% of Americans disapproving of Trump's handling of inflation
- The Economist/YouGov survey indicates Trump's approval rating on inflation and prices has fallen from +6 to -18, a 24-point drop
- The Marquette Law School national poll from May 21, 2025, places Trump's net approval on inflation and cost of living at -32%

These figures place Trump's current net inflation approval between -32% and -18%, firmly in negative territory and among his worst-performing policy areas.

## Key Factors Affecting Future Approval

Several critical factors will likely influence Trump's inflation approval by June 25:

**Tariff Policies**: Trump recently postponed a decision on imposing a 50% tariff on European imports until July 9. While this delay has provided some temporary market relief, his broader tariff strategy continues to worry economists and consumers. As Torsten Slok, Apollo chief economist, noted, "consensus inflation expectations have been steadily rising, driven by tariffs and upward pressure on housing inflation."

**Federal Reserve Actions**: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet on June 17-18, just before the forecast date. The Fed's decisions and commentary on inflation will significantly influence public perception of the inflation situation and, by extension, Trump's handling of it.

**Economic Data Releases**: The May 2025 CPI data will be released on June 11, providing the most recent official inflation figures before the June 25 measurement. If inflation remains elevated or increases, this would likely further damage Trump's approval on this issue.

**Trade Negotiations**: There are signs of potential progress in trade talks, with National Economic Council director hinting that "a few more" trade agreements could be announced soon. Successful negotiations could reduce tariffs and lead to market optimism.

## Trend Analysis

Trump's overall approval ratings have shown some volatility:
- His overall job approval has declined during his second term, starting at +7.2 in his first week but falling to -7.3 by early May 2025
- There has been a slight rebound in May, possibly due to his more conciliatory tone on tariffs
- The stock market has responded positively to these developments, which could improve some voters' economic perceptions

However, on economic issues specifically, the trend remains negative:
- Trump's approval on the economy remains at a net negative
- Inflation continues to be one of his worst-performing areas
- Public opinion on economic issues tends to be "sticky" and slow to shift without dramatically better news

## Probability Assessment

Considering all these factors, here's the probability distribution for Trump's net approval rating on inflation as of June 25, 2025:

1. **<-30.0%**: 20% probability
   There's a substantial chance that Trump's inflation approval could remain below -30% or worsen further. This could occur if the May CPI data shows significant inflation increases, the Fed expresses strong concerns about inflation, or if new controversial tariff announcements emerge.

2. **≥-30.0% and ≤-20.0%**: 40% probability
   This range represents a continuation of the current deeply negative sentiment toward Trump's handling of inflation. Given the structural factors in place (existing tariffs, persistent economic concerns) and the relative slowness with which public opinion typically changes, this outcome has the highest probability.

3. **>-20.0% and <-10.0%**: 30% probability
   This range would represent a meaningful improvement from current levels. While possible, especially given the slight rebound in Trump's overall approval ratings in May, the entrenched negative perceptions around inflation make significant improvement challenging in the short term.

4. **≥-10.0%**: 10% probability
   A dramatic improvement to near-neutral territory would require a major positive economic development or a significant shift in inflation data. This could occur with unexpectedly positive May CPI data, a surprise Fed rate cut with optimistic messaging, or a breakthrough in trade negotiations that significantly reduces tariffs.

The most likely outcome is that Trump's net approval on inflation will remain firmly negative, between -30% and -20%, reflecting the persistence of public concern about inflation and the limited time for significant policy changes to affect public opinion before June 25.
