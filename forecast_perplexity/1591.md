Rationale:

The interest in Effective Altruism (EA) on Google Trends is likely to remain at least 0.2 times the 2017 level by 2030. This assessment is based on several key factors:

1. Historical Stability: Despite peaking in 2017, interest in EA has shown resilience and stability in subsequent years. The movement has maintained a measurable presence on Google Trends, indicating a consistent base of interest.

2. Organizational Growth: EA has continued to experience organizational growth and development, even as search trends plateaued. This suggests a maturing movement with established infrastructure, which can help sustain long-term interest.

3. Adaptability: The EA movement has demonstrated an ability to evolve and address new global challenges, which could help maintain or even increase its relevance over time.

4. Potential for Renewed Interest: Global events, technological advancements, or increased focus on existential risks could spark a resurgence in EA principles, potentially leading to higher search volumes.

5. Changing Information Access: While Google Trends data may be impacted by shifts in how people access EA information (e.g., direct website visits), this doesn't necessarily indicate reduced overall interest in the movement.

However, there are potential risks to consider:

1. Controversies or Scandals: The movement could face challenges that damage its reputation and reduce public interest.

2. Methodology Changes: Alterations to Google Trends' methodology could affect data comparability over time.

3. Shift in Public Focus: Changes in global priorities or competing ideologies could divert attention from EA principles.

Given the movement's established presence, continued growth, and ability to adapt to changing circumstances, it seems more likely that EA will maintain at least 20% of its 2017 interest level than experience a dramatic decline. While there's uncertainty due to the long time horizon, the foundation laid by EA's current trajectory provides a strong buffer against falling below the threshold.
