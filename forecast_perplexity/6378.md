Nuclear safety has significantly improved since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, with enhanced protocols, international cooperation, and technological advancements in reactor design. These factors contribute to a reduced likelihood of major nuclear accidents. The nuclear industry has learned from past incidents and implemented more stringent safety measures globally.

However, several risk factors persist. Aging infrastructure in some countries, the potential for human error, and the unpredictability of natural disasters all contribute to a non-zero risk. The increasing effects of climate change could potentially play a role in elevating risks to nuclear facilities. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and the expansion of nuclear power in regions with less experience in nuclear operations could potentially increase risks.

Historical context is crucial in assessing this probability. Only two level 7 events on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) have occurred since its introduction in 1990: Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. This rarity suggests that such catastrophic events occur approximately once every 15-20 years.

The global trend towards renewable energy might gradually reduce the number of operational nuclear plants, potentially decreasing the overall risk of accidents. However, this trend is unlikely to significantly impact the risk profile before 2030. Conversely, ongoing nuclear developments, such as China and Russia's ambitious plans for lunar nuclear power, indicate continued expansion of nuclear technologies, which could maintain a baseline level of risk.

Cyberattacks pose an emerging threat to nuclear facilities, as loss of control at a reactor could potentially lead to a severe accident. This factor adds a new dimension to the risk assessment that wasn't present in earlier decades.

Balancing these factors, while acknowledging that unexpected events can occur, the probability of a major nuclear accident before 2030 remains low but not negligible. The continued focus on nuclear safety, coupled with the historical rarity of such events, suggests that while the risk exists, it is relatively small within the given timeframe.
