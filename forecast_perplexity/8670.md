The historical precedent and constitutional framework strongly favor maintaining the status quo, where the US President retains sole authority over the use of nuclear weapons. This structure has persisted since the inception of nuclear weapons, enduring through various administrations and geopolitical climates. The complexity of implementing changes to this authority presents significant legal and institutional barriers. The constitutional role of the President as Commander in Chief, combined with the need for rapid decision-making in nuclear scenarios, supports the continuation of the current command and control structure.

While there is ongoing discussion and some political interest in reforming this authority, significant hurdles exist. A potential scenario for change would require a significant geopolitical crisis or domestic political shift that leads to a strong bipartisan consensus in Congress to pass legislation requiring additional authorization for the first use of nuclear weapons. This could involve requiring the consent of key congressional leaders or other high-ranking officials. However, such changes would need to overcome constitutional challenges and be signed into law by the President.

The geopolitical environment, which often emphasizes the need for rapid decision-making capabilities, further supports the status quo. Although there have been calls for reform, particularly during certain administrations, the enduring nature of the current system and the slow pace of change in such entrenched systems suggest that substantial changes are unlikely by 2030. Additionally, public opinion and the geopolitical environment would need to shift significantly to overcome these barriers. Given these factors, the probability of a change occurring by 2030 remains relatively low.
