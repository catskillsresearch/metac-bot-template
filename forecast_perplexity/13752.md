# Will US Law Continue Prohibiting NASA Cooperation with the Chinese Government Before 2030?

The Wolf Amendment has been a cornerstone of US space policy toward China since its enactment in 2011. This legislation prohibits NASA from using federal funds for direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government or Chinese-owned entities without explicit certification from Congress and the FBI. As of June 2025, the amendment remains firmly in place, having been consistently renewed in annual appropriations with little substantive change.

## Current Status and Implementation

The Wolf Amendment continues to shape US-China space relations in significant ways. While there have been occasional exceptions for specific scientific collaborations, these required explicit Congressional authorization and do not represent a policy shift or amendment repeal. For example, NASA has carefully navigated the process of obtaining lunar samples from China's Chang'e-5 mission, with NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noting: "We are going through the process right now with our scientists and our lawyers to make sure that the instructions and guardrails that the Chinese are insisting on... are not a violation of the law, the Wolf Amendment".

These limited collaborations operate within the framework of the amendment rather than challenging it. The fact that NASA must undergo careful legal scrutiny for even basic scientific exchanges reinforces the amendment's continuing impact.

## Geopolitical Context

The broader US-China relationship shows increasing tensions rather than rapprochement. Recent developments indicate a climate of technological competition and security concerns:

1. The US appears to be expanding restrictions on China across multiple sectors
2. China has accelerated its own space program, partnering with Russia on lunar projects and establishing the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) as an alternative to the US-led Artemis program
3. Chinese space officials have publicly criticized US restrictions, with Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar program, stating "Now it's China that is open, while the US is becoming increasingly isolated"

## Factors Supporting Continuity of Restrictions

Several powerful factors suggest the Wolf Amendment will persist through 2030:

- **Bipartisan Support**: The amendment has enjoyed consistent support across administrations and from both political parties, reflecting enduring concerns about technology transfer and national security
- **Legislative Inertia**: The amendment has been renewed annually for over 14 years with minimal debate, demonstrating remarkable stability
- **Increasing Competition**: China's rapid advancement in space capabilities has heightened competitive tensions rather than fostering cooperation
- **National Security Concerns**: Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers maintain concerns about technology transfer and security risks

## Potential for Change

Despite strong evidence for continuation, some factors could potentially lead to change:

- **Scientific Collaboration Pressure**: Scientists continue to advocate for increased cooperation, as evidenced by attempts to share lunar samples despite restrictions
- **China's Growing Space Prominence**: As China achieves more space milestones independently, the US may reconsider its approach to maintain influence in space governance
- **Specific Collaborative Opportunities**: Scientific missions or space emergencies could create pressure for exceptions or broader changes to the policy

However, these factors appear insufficient to overcome the powerful forces maintaining the status quo. The Harvard International Review has noted that the Wolf Amendment "undermines an international culture of multilateralism in space by sowing distrust between major space superpowers", but this criticism has not translated to policy changes in Washington.

## Analysis and Outlook

The evidence strongly suggests the Wolf Amendment will remain in place through 2030. For the amendment to be overturned, we would need to see a significant shift in US-China relations or a major change in Congressional attitudes, neither of which appears likely based on current trends. The occasional scientific exchanges that have occurred operate within the framework of the Wolf Amendment rather than challenging it.

The status quo has powerful inertia in this policy area. Barring a dramatic shift in US-China relations or a compelling national security or scientific reason to change course, the most likely outcome is continued renewal of the Wolf Amendment through 2030.
