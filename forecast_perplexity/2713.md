## Rationale for HIV/AIDS Prevalence in 2037 vs. 2017

Global HIV/AIDS prevalence is determined by the dynamic interplay between new infections, mortality, access to effective treatment, advances in prevention, and demographic factors. As of the end of 2023, 39.9 million people were living with HIV worldwide, up from 36.9 million in 2017. This increase has occurred despite significant global efforts to control the epidemic.

**Expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage** has been the primary driver of reduced AIDS-related deaths and prolonged survival for people living with HIV. The scaling up of ART has led to near-normal life expectancies in many regions, creating a demographic momentum where the number of people living with HIV grows or remains stable even if new infection rates decline moderately.

While **new HIV infections have declined from historic peaks**, progress has stalled, with 1.3 million new infections globally in 2023â€”well above international targets for epidemic control. Prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and long-acting injectables, are promising but have not yet been adopted quickly or widely enough to drive steep reductions in incidence, primarily due to funding and access constraints.

**Funding limitations pose a significant risk**. Recent years have seen notable reductions in international donor support, including threats to large-scale programs like PEPFAR and USAID. Modeling studies project that these cuts could result in millions of additional HIV infections and deaths by 2030 if not reversed, threatening to undo decades of progress and making it increasingly likely that prevalence remains elevated or grows further.

**Population growth, especially in high-burden regions like sub-Saharan Africa**, exerts upward pressure on overall prevalence. Even with slight reductions in infection rates, the absolute number of cases may continue to grow due to broader demographic trends.

Geographically, **some regions will see increases while others may experience declines**. For example, prevalence is expected to increase in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and parts of North Africa, while sub-Saharan Africa may witness slight declines in percentage terms but potentially stable or even increased absolute numbers, given its large baseline.

**Medical breakthroughs, such as a functional cure or widely available, highly effective vaccine**, remain unlikely to be implemented at population scale before 2037, based on current research trajectories. As a result, the dominant factors shaping epidemic trends will continue to be ART coverage, prevention efficacy, funding stability, and regional demographic changes.

In summary, unless there is an unprecedented global turnaround in prevention, a transformative biomedical advance, or a sustained and significant increase in funding and political commitment, the global population living with HIV/AIDS in 2037 is expected to meet or exceed the 2017 benchmark. The convergence of improved survival, ongoing new infections, and demographic momentum strongly suggests a continuation of current trends, with prevalence stabilizing at high levels or rising modestly.
