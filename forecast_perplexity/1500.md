Rationale:

The risk of a global catastrophe due to human-made climate change or geoengineering by 2100 is significant enough to warrant serious concern and preventative action, though the status quo outcome of no catastrophe remains the most likely scenario.

Current climate projections, while serious, generally do not predict population declines of 10% within 5 years solely due to climate impacts. The timeframe until 2100 allows for significant adaptation and mitigation efforts. However, recent reports indicate accelerating warming trends and more frequent extreme weather events, suggesting that the risk is non-negligible and potentially increasing.

The "fat tail" risk of high-end warming scenarios could lead to catastrophic outcomes, especially if critical tipping points are crossed. Runaway climate change could trigger cascading failures in food production and habitability of large regions, causing mass migration and conflict. The interconnected nature of global risks means that climate impacts could amplify or trigger other catastrophic risks, such as economic collapse or geopolitical instability.

Geoengineering presents a wildcard factor. While it could potentially mitigate some climate risks, it also introduces new catastrophic risks, particularly from abrupt termination or hasty implementation. Large-scale deployment of technologies like solar radiation management carries the potential for unintended consequences, including rapid environmental changes that could cause widespread crop failures and ecosystem collapse.

The long timeframe increases uncertainty, allowing for both positive developments (e.g., technological breakthroughs, effective international cooperation) and negative ones (e.g., compounding climate impacts, governance failures exacerbating climate vulnerability). The potential for technological advances in mitigation, adaptation, and safe geoengineering must be considered, which could reduce risks over time.

Given these factors, while the status quo remains most likely, the probability of a catastrophic outcome principally due to climate change or geoengineering is significant enough to necessitate serious preventative measures and continued monitoring of climate trends and geoengineering developments.
