Pat Herrity, formerly seen as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia, officially withdrew from the race on April 21, 2025, citing significant health complications following heart surgery. Herrity stated that while his doctors are optimistic about a full recovery, the pace of his recuperation is much slower than anticipated, and the ongoing health challenges prevent him from committing the energy necessary for a statewide campaign. He emphasized that continuing in the race could negatively affect both his health and the effectiveness of the Republican ticket.

With Herrity's withdrawal, only John Reid remained as a qualified Republican candidate, leading the Virginia Department of Elections to cancel the planned Republican primary for lieutenant governor, as state law requires at least two qualified candidates for a primary to be held. The party and electoral authorities have recognized John Reid as the official Republican nominee for the office.

There is no credible information, procedural path, or public indication suggesting that Herrity intends or is able to reverse his withdrawal, re-enter the race, or trigger the reinstatement of the primary. The party has finalized its statewide ticket, and all official filings reflect this new status. The combination of clearly documented health obstacles, finalized party decisions, and state election regulations makes any alternative scenario—such as Herrity rejoining the contest and winning—extraordinarily implausible.
