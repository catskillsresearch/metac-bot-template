Over the past several years, the European Union has undertaken significant consultations, stakeholder engagements, and policy studies aimed at improving transparency and harmonization in animal welfare labelling. The driving force behind these efforts is strong consumer demand for clearer information about farm animal welfare, as evidenced by a European Commission study in which 90% of respondents supported an EU-wide animal welfare label and two-thirds felt they lack adequate information about animal conditions.

Advocacy groups such as FOUR PAWS and various national agencies have articulated clear criteria for a future labelling system: it should be mandatory, multi-tiered, cover all major livestock (chickens, pigs, cows) and all stages of production (including rearing, transport, and slaughter), provide simple and comprehensible labels for consumers, and be backed by independent verification systems. Recent guidelines published by the French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) have laid out concrete proposals for multi-level systems—envisioning, for example, five tiers from A to E for mandatory labelling—demonstrating growing technical momentum for standardization.

Despite this momentum and broad stakeholder alignment, the reality as of mid-2025 is that the only EU-wide mandatory animal welfare label currently in force covers table eggs, while other schemes remain voluntary or are managed at the national level. Member states such as Germany and France have rolled out their own multi-tiered labelling schemes, but disparate national approaches reflect the complexity of achieving EU-wide harmonization.

Legislative progress at the Union level has been ongoing, with the European Commission expected to present a proposal for animal welfare labelling “over the next years,” following the outcomes from the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of EU Agriculture. However, the most authoritative recent indications point to this proposal likely establishing a harmonized, voluntary, and multi-tier label—rather than a mandatory, Union-wide regime. Bureaucratic inertia, protracted negotiations among member states with divergent interests, and the scale of economic adaptation required contribute to slow progress. Even where there is agreement on goals, the legislative, technical, and implementation phases that must precede mandatory, comprehensive enforcement typically span several years.

While policy documents and draft roadmaps published in early 2025 confirm the EU’s intention to strengthen animal welfare standards and explore more stringent labelling requirements, there are no credible announcements or legislative actions signaling imminent enforcement of a mandatory, multi-tiered animal welfare labelling system for all major livestock products by the end of 2025. Ongoing initiatives, including enhanced guidelines, national pilots, and stakeholder consultations, are laying the groundwork for future harmonization, but the timeline for actual mandatory, pan-European implementation extends beyond the scope of the current year.

In sum, the EU is steadily advancing toward greater harmonization and transparency in animal welfare labelling, propelled by consumer demand, advocacy, and national innovation. Yet, given the institutional, legislative, and practical hurdles, as well as the prevailing direction toward voluntary rather than mandatory systems in the immediate term, the adoption and enforcement of a mandatory multi-tiered animal welfare labelling scheme across the EU is unlikely to occur by December 2025.
