The current state of research in mammalian aging suggests that achieving a 2,500-day lifespan for laboratory mice is unlikely without significant scientific advancements. The longest-lived laboratory mouse on record is approximately 1,800 days, and there have been no major breakthroughs or announcements in the field that would plausibly enable a mouse to live to 2,500 days. The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is a No, as research efforts continue to focus on incremental improvements in healthspan rather than dramatic increases in maximum lifespan. 

However, a scenario that could result in a Yes outcome would involve a major breakthrough in biotechnology or genetic engineering. This could include the discovery of a new class of anti-aging drugs, genetic modifications, or a combination of treatments that significantly extend the lifespan of laboratory mice. Such breakthroughs might involve novel approaches to cellular repair, rejuvenation, or a synergistic combination of existing and new interventions that enhance longevity.

While there are ongoing efforts and some promising research in the field, such as the combination of rapamycin and trametinib extending mouse lifespans by up to 30%, these results are still far from achieving the 2,500-day mark. The gap between the current record and the required lifespan is substantial, and achieving this would likely require a transformative advance in mammalian aging biology. The probability of such a breakthrough occurring before 2035 is moderate but not high, as significant scientific advancements often take time to develop and validate. Given the historical pace of scientific progress in this area, the probability of a transformative breakthrough within the next decade remains uncertain, but it is not impossible.
