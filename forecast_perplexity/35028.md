## Rationale for 2024 Global Average Wealth Per Adult Increase

Global wealth per adult in 2024 continued its long-term upward trajectory, bolstered by a combination of worldwide economic recovery, asset appreciation, and ongoing development in key regions. After a downturn in 2022, both average and median wealth per adult rebounded in 2023 and 2024, following historical patterns where, in the absence of major crises, wealth accumulation gradually resumes. The return of broad-based economic growth, evidenced by a 4.2% increase in global wealth during 2024, supported wealth expansion not just among the ultra-wealthy but also within the broader population.

The strongest gains were seen in emerging markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific, where sustained growth contributed to the convergence of wealth levels with those in more developed regions. While wealth inequality intensified, with wealth concentration at the top accelerating and billionaires' fortunes growing sharply, this uneven distribution did not negate gains for the typical adult. Proxy data from key sources such as the UBS Global Wealth Report showed both average and median wealth per adult rose in 2023 and 2024, and no significant macroeconomic shocks or global recessions emerged to suppress median or average values.

Further supporting the increase, regional performance remained positive, with household wealth in emerging economies like India and Southeast Asia rising, while advanced economies maintained stability. The Americas, particularly the United States, experienced above-average wealth growth rates compared to historical norms, further lifting global averages. Structural risks—such as a sudden global recession, severe asset price declines, or widespread currency devaluation—did not materialize at a scale sufficient to reverse these trends in 2024.

Although rising inequality primarily influences the mean wealth more than the median, broad-based economic and asset recovery has typically translated into higher wealth accumulation for the median adult during periods of global expansion. Currency and asset revaluations remained relatively stable, and, apart from a handful of outlier economies, negative growth in wealth per adult was rare in 2024.

Consequently, the combination of sustained economic momentum, positive asset market performance, and the absence of systemic global downturns strongly favors an outcome where global average and median wealth per adult both increased in 2024 compared to 2023. This result aligns with status quo trends observed across multiple decades, where global wealth metrics tend to rise incrementally absent major disruptive events.
