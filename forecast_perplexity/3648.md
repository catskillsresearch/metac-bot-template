There are approximately 4½ to 5 years remaining until the criteria are assessed. Recent advances in conversational AI have led to impressive short-term performance, but these systems still face significant challenges when it comes to sustaining context-rich dialogue over extended, multi‐hour interactions. Present models often struggle with maintaining long‐term memory, ensuring internal consistency, and executing human‐level reasoning throughout prolonged conversations. Because expert assessments rely on the nuanced, sustained engagement characteristic of human interaction, even small lapses over the course of a 24‐hour, multi-judge testing session can reveal an AI’s shortcomings.

Meeting the stringent requirements of the test would likely necessitate a breakthrough—such as the development of novel architectures that integrate the fluency of current deep learning systems with more robust memory retention and symbolic or hybrid reasoning capabilities. Without such a major innovation, incremental, though steady, progress will probably fall short of the full human-like conversational consistency required. 

Thus, while there is optimism about future improvements, the current trajectory suggests that without transformative advances, the AI systems will remain distinguishable from human behavior under rigorous, long-duration scrutiny.
