The window for possible resignations of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) before July 1, 2025, falls amid a high-profile and rapidly evolving corruption investigation centered on allegations that Huawei sought to influence EU policy through illicit lobbying practices. Belgian prosecutors have charged several individuals associated with Huawei and have taken robust investigative actions, including more than 20 raids across Belgium and Portugal, arrests, and the seizure of documents and devices. While up to 15 current and former MEPs are reportedly under scrutiny, as of June 5, 2025, no sitting MEP has publicly announced their resignation or been formally charged, though significant pressure surrounds the five whose parliamentary immunity Belgian authorities have requested to lift.

Historically, major corruption scandals in the European Parliament—such as the "Qatargate" affair—have eventually led to resignations, but the timeline from initial allegation to resignation is often hampered by procedural hurdles. Parliamentary immunity acts as a substantial safeguard, typically requiring formal votes and legal steps to be waived, which slows down proceedings and reduces the likelihood of immediate resignations even when investigations are active and highly publicized. The process for lifting immunity for five named MEPs is currently underway, but no immunity has yet been revoked, indicating that legal consequences compelling resignations are not imminent.

Despite the inertia from parliamentary protections, several factors could still accelerate the path to resignation. The seriousness of the allegations—encompassing bribery, money laundering, and participation in a criminal organization—coupled with ongoing media attention and public scrutiny, places significant reputational and political pressure on implicated MEPs and their parties. European Parliament leadership, responding to both internal and external calls for accountability, may act decisively if new evidence emerges or if the legal process rapidly advances, especially if parties seek to limit collateral damage ahead of upcoming parliamentary business.

However, as of early June, the momentum of the investigation has yet to breach institutional barriers or provoke visible cracks in MEP ranks. Many implicated lawmakers deny wrongdoing, and no major political group has publicly called for resignation. The European Anti-Fraud Office’s decision not to open its own parallel investigation further tempers immediate pressure. While Belgian prosecutors are moving with relative speed—given the scale of the case and recent charges against non-parliamentary actors—European institutions generally move deliberately, especially under the constraints of legal immunity and procedural safeguards.

With less than four weeks remaining until the deadline, the scenario most consistent with current evidence is one of continued investigation, mounting political pressure, and increased scrutiny, but with no guarantee of resignation before July 1, 2025. Only a substantial escalation—such as the public unveiling of conclusive evidence, rapid lifting of immunity, or internal party intervention—would likely prompt an MEP to resign within this narrow window. Thus, while a resignation remains plausible given the gravity of the scandal and the growing list of implicated lawmakers, procedural inertia, the status quo, and legal protections make it less likely, though not impossible, for such an event to occur in the specified timeframe.
