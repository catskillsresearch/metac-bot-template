A comprehensive analysis of how many "Level 4 – Do Not Travel" advisories the US State Department will issue in June 2025 draws from current issuance patterns, the global security landscape, and historical behaviors. As of late May 2025, there are 21 countries under Level 4 advisories, reflecting the highest threshold for travel risk where life-threatening dangers—such as armed conflict, terrorism, political instability, violent crime, and potential wrongful detention—are present, and US government support is highly limited or unavailable.

The issuance of Level 4 advisories typically follows real-time assessments of rapidly evolving situations. Over recent months, the State Department has issued new or renewed Level 4 advisories about once a month, with notable recent examples including Venezuela (May 12, 2025), Burkina Faso (April 16, 2025), and North Korea (April 2025). This relatively steady frequency is informed by continual monitoring of both chronic risk environments and emerging threats.

Factors likely to influence the number of new Level 4 advisories in June 2025 include:

- **Ongoing Global Conflicts and Instability:** Areas already experiencing unrest, like parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, remain at risk for deteriorating conditions that could prompt new advisories. Recent tensions in places such as the Philippines and Bangladesh are particularly notable.
- **Routine Review Cycles:** The State Department conducts periodic reviews of travel advisories, potentially leading to updates or reissuance as risk profiles are reassessed, especially at the start of a busy travel period like the Northern Hemisphere summer.
- **Sudden Geopolitical Events:** While historically rare, a spike in conflict, a major terrorist incident, or a coup could result in multiple concurrent Level 4 advisories if several countries become newly high-risk at once.
- **Incremental Upgrades from Level 3:** Countries flagged as "Reconsider Travel" (Level 3) may be elevated to Level 4 if security and political worsening is observed, but such escalations are typically situational rather than wholesale.

Despite always-present uncertainty, no emerging global crisis appears likely to trigger mass upgrades at this time. Advisories tend to be issued individually and in direct response to concrete changes on the ground, rather than as part of broad, scheduled overhauls. Most months see zero, one, or occasionally two new Level 4 advisories, with higher counts relatively uncommon unless triggered by exceptional global events.

In sum, the existing trend and absence of any large-scale, imminent global instability point toward a forecast of one new or reissued Level 4 advisory in June 2025 being most likely, with some probability for zero or two, and a small chance of more than two if a major crisis emerges. This outlook balances historical issuance rates, bureaucratic review practices, and the persistent but unpredictable risk of sudden global events.
