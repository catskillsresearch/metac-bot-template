## Rationale

Over the course of 2025, Russian forces have maintained a steady but largely incremental tempo of advance in Ukraine, gaining limited territory mostly in rural or contested border regions—particularly in the northern parts of Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts. The rate of Russian advances has slowed considerably compared to earlier periods of the war, with territory gained often measured week-to-week in the range of 14 to 50 square miles, and monthly totals typically below 200 square miles. These gains are significant in local contexts but do not approach the scale required to seize and consolidate control over major Ukrainian urban centers such as Kharkiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia city, Mikolaiv, Sumy, Lozova, or Chernihiv.

The Russian military's current operational focus is primarily on creating “buffer zones” near the border—expanding control in small settlements and rural districts—rather than launching or sustaining deep operations against heavily fortified regional capitals. Despite persistent rhetoric from Russian leaders about broader objectives and the potential for sweeping advances, such statements are widely understood as strategic messaging rather than reflections of actual short-term military capability. Even when Russian officials have spoken of plans to “squeeze” Ukrainian forces further back or to expand the war’s territorial scope, battlefield realities consistently show that Russia lacks both the force quality and the logistical depth to mount major new offensives into these defended cities.

Operational constraints—especially high attrition rates among Russian personnel and equipment, combined with continued reliance on less trained recruits—are steadily degrading Russia’s ability to generate overwhelming offensive power. Western intelligence and defense assessments point out that unless there is a dramatic collapse in Ukrainian defenses or a sudden cessation of Western military assistance, Russia is increasingly unlikely to achieve significant additional gains through 2025. While Russian forces could continue to press and potentially complete the capture of minor towns or the last contested pockets in areas like Luhansk or Donetsk, the probability of capturing and holding at least two major new cities from the specified list by January 1, 2026, remains low.

Ukrainian defenses around key cities have been deeply layered and bolstered by ongoing Western support, creating substantial obstacles to any rapid or deep Russian advance. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, while strained, continue to hold the line, and even with some fluctuation in Western aid delivery, there is no strong indication of an impending collapse in either Ukrainian military resistance or international backing. Moreover, the pace of the conflict, shaped by attrition and logistical exhaustion on both sides, favors continued incremental change rather than sudden, large-scale territorial shifts.

There remains a non-trivial risk of unexpected developments—such as sudden breakdowns in Ukrainian defensive cohesion, major political settlement, or collapse in international support—which could open the door to a more dramatic Russian advance. However, current indicators do not suggest any of these scenarios are imminent or likely within the remaining months of 2025. Instead, the most probable trajectory is that the front lines will remain broadly stable, with Russia securing incremental “buffer zones” but not the significant, urban-centered expansions required by the resolution criteria for a “Yes” outcome.

Overall, Russian advances are likely to be confined to slow consolidation in border areas and limited attritional gains, constrained by growing operational and material challenges, persistent Ukrainian defenses, and the inertia typical of high-intensity, attritional warfare. Only a major, presently unforeseen shock to the conflict’s dynamics would allow Russia to seize and hold two or more major cities before January 1, 2026.
