Argentina’s inflation trajectory has shifted dramatically since late 2023, driven largely by the implementation of aggressive fiscal and monetary tightening measures. After peaking at 292% year-over-year (YoY) in April 2024, the annual inflation rate had fallen sharply to 47.3% by April 2025. Monthly inflation, which soared to 25.5% during the transition period, has stabilized in the 2.2%–2.8% range through the first half of 2025, reflecting both a rapid and sustained disinflation process.

This improvement is directly linked to a policy agenda that includes strict fiscal discipline with a zero-deficit target, the elimination of central bank financing for government spending, and management of the exchange rate through a 1% monthly crawling peg. The result has been Argentina’s first fiscal surplus in over a decade, a factor cited by both local and international analysts as fundamental to the recent inflation slowdown. These measures have also supported the stabilization of inflation expectations, further anchoring the disinflation trend.

Expert and market forecasts have moved consistently downward in recent months. The Central Bank’s Market Expectations Survey (REM) now projects a 23.2–23.3% inflation rate for December 2025. Other major forecasters, including BBVA Research and Trading Economics, foresee year-end inflation near 30% or slightly below. Consensus surveys by organizations such as LatinFocus and FocusEconomics similarly cluster projections in the 23%–28% range, reflecting broad market confidence in the downward trajectory. Older, more pessimistic projections—like the IMF’s late-2024 estimate of 62.7% for 2025—now appear significantly out of date in light of the rapid recent improvement.

The ongoing disinflation is further supported by the base effect, as the high inflation of late 2024 creates favorable year-over-year comparisons throughout 2025. Provided monthly inflation continues at or below current levels, the mathematical path leads to a December 2025 YoY figure under 30%.

Risks, however, remain material. Political uncertainty ahead of the October 2025 legislative elections could threaten fiscal discipline and policy continuity. Central bank reserves have experienced intermittent declines, raising the specter of renewed exchange rate instability or forced devaluations, which could quickly pass through to consumer prices. Additional vulnerabilities include potential external shocks, wage pressures, and social unrest resulting from economic contraction and falling real wages.

Despite these risks, the prevailing momentum, the government’s demonstrated policy resolve, and the convergence of independent forecasts below the 30% threshold mean that Argentina is currently on a credible path toward achieving sub-30% inflation by December 2025. The scenario most consistent with current data, expert consensus, and the policy landscape is continued—if incremental—progress in reducing inflation, barring a major shock or reversal in the administration’s approach.
