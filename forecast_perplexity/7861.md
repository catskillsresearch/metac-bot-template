China has adopted a pragmatic, strategically driven approach to its relationship with the Taliban-led Afghanistan, characterized by deepening diplomatic, economic, and security engagement while deliberately withholding formal recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Since the Taliban’s return to power, China has incrementally upgraded its ties—most notably becoming the first country to accredit a Taliban-appointed ambassador to Beijing in late 2023—while maintaining a clear distinction between engagement and full diplomatic endorsement.

Central to China's calculations are several key interests:
- **Counterterrorism:** Beijing’s overriding priority is ensuring the Taliban prevent Afghan territory from being used by militants targeting China, especially the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which Beijing holds responsible for unrest in Xinjiang. China’s persistent demands for the Taliban to take verifiable action against Uyghur militants remain unmet to its satisfaction. The May 2025 trilateral meeting in Beijing with Taliban and Pakistani officials underscored China’s efforts to broker regional security guarantees, protect its Belt and Road investments (notably the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), and counter mutual terrorist threats.
- **Economic and strategic interests:** Afghanistan’s mineral wealth and its role as a corridor for Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects are significant drivers of China's engagement. China seeks stability, security for Chinese nationals and interests, and exclusive access to resources.
- **Regional influence and stability:** By mediating high-level talks between Pakistan and the Taliban, China aims to reduce regional tensions and position itself as an indispensable power broker, enhancing its leverage without the legal or reputational costs of formal recognition.

Despite these deepening ties, China remains highly cautious about extending formal recognition. It continues to weigh the substantial diplomatic risks, particularly the potential backlash from the international community over the Taliban’s human rights record and lack of political inclusivity. China is acutely aware that being the first major power to legitimize the Taliban carries significant reputational drawbacks and may diminish its leverage with the Taliban on key issues such as counterterrorism and political reform.

China’s approach is thus characterized by:
- **Maximizing engagement while retaining leverage:** By upgrading diplomatic relations short of recognition, Beijing maintains influence and access while keeping formal legitimacy as a bargaining chip. This strategy gives China flexibility to respond to future developments without being locked into a binding diplomatic stance.
- **Conditionality and inertia:** Official recognition is expressly contingent on tangible progress by the Taliban, particularly on China’s security concerns and the formation of a more inclusive government. The experience of other regional powers—such as Russia and Pakistan, which have also accepted Taliban ambassadors without granting recognition—reinforces a regional pattern of cautious engagement.
- **Possibility of external accelerants:** Should other major regional actors (such as Russia or Pakistan) move to recognize the Taliban first, or should broader international consensus emerge, China may reassess the costs and benefits of recognition. Similarly, internal or regional security crises—or a shift in the Taliban’s behavior—could tip Beijing toward formalizing ties.

Despite the clear trajectory of growing China-Taliban cooperation, the “status quo bias” is strong: history and recent diplomatic practice indicate that states are slow to move from deep engagement to outright recognition of regimes facing broad international non-recognition or sanctions, especially when reputational stakes are high.

In sum, while China has sharply elevated its relationship with the Taliban regime and stands ready to further deepen it if its conditions are met, it will likely maintain its policy of hedged engagement short of formal recognition until either the Taliban take significant steps to address Chinese concerns or regional and international dynamics shift sufficiently to reduce the costs and risks of recognition.
