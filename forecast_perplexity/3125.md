## Combined Rationale: Will the United States Remain Among the 20 Largest Deteriorators in State Stability (2019–2029, Fragile States Index)?

The United States experienced a notable deterioration in its Fragile States Index (FSI) score over the past two decades, ranking #12 globally for the largest increase in fragility from 2009–2019. This period was marked by ongoing political polarization, declining labor and civil rights, and worsening international perceptions. However, the trajectory since 2019 shows nuanced developments: the US FSI score peaked at 46.6 in 2022 but has since shown modest improvement, declining to 44.5 by 2024. This suggests a possible stabilization or even a reversal of recent deterioration trends.

The FSI assesses state stability on a relative basis, ranking countries by the **magnitude of their score change over a ten-year period**. The US’s continued presence among the top 20 deteriorators thus relies not only on its own trajectory but also on the pace and scale of changes in other nations.

Historically, the countries with the largest decade-long FSI increases are those experiencing *acute crises*—such as active armed conflict, coups, economic collapse, or profound humanitarian emergencies. Current global events highlight severe instability in countries like Niger, Sudan, Ethiopia, Russia, Israel, Mongolia, Venezuela, and Afghanistan. These countries are undergoing sharper, more rapid deterioration than the US, especially given the recent stabilization in the US’s FSI score.

While the US faces serious ongoing challenges—persistent political polarization, institutional strain, declining state legitimacy, and deteriorating labor rights—these issues have not precipitated the systemic breakdowns or intense crises typically seen among the world’s fastest-deteriorating states. Instead, the US remains more resilient by global standards, supported by strong institutions and economic resources. The average FSI score for the US remains well below the global mean, and its absolute fragility—while higher than a decade ago—does not approach the levels seen in countries experiencing civil war, state collapse, or humanitarian disaster.

Nonetheless, the risk of renewed or accelerated instability is present. Potential triggers could include severe constitutional crises, a contested election, mass civil unrest, or the breakdown of core governance structures. Any such shock could lead to a sharp increase in the US FSI score, potentially keeping it among the top 20 deteriorators if other countries’ situations stabilize or improve unexpectedly.

Recent global patterns, however, suggest increased fragility and conflict elsewhere is likely to continue, making it more probable that the US’s relative position will improve over the decade—even if its internal challenges persist at current levels. In the absence of dramatic new crises within the US, the expectation is that other nations will outpace it in terms of decade-scale FSI deterioration.

In summary, while the United States continues to face significant and entrenched challenges to its state stability—including polarization, declining international standing, and labor rights issues—the pace of its deterioration has moderated since 2022. Given the relative nature of FSI rankings and the acute crises occurring in multiple other states, the most plausible trajectory is that the US will not remain among the top 20 countries with the largest deterioration in state stability for the 2019–2029 period—unless it experiences a significant escalation in systemic instability before the end of the decade.
