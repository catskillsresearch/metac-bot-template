The current political landscape in Russia is characterized by strong control under Vladimir Putin's leadership, with a narrative that justifies the invasion of Ukraine. This status quo suggests that if nothing changes, the next Russian leader is unlikely to disapprove of the invasion. The centralized control and investment in the war narrative make a sudden policy shift less likely without a significant catalyst. However, historical precedents indicate that leadership changes can lead to policy reversals, particularly following costly or unpopular conflicts. 

A potential scenario for a shift in policy could arise from significant political changes within Russia, driven by internal dissent, economic pressures, or international isolation. Such a shift might lead to a new leader who seeks to restore relations with the international community and address domestic issues by condemning the invasion and withdrawing Russian forces from occupied territories. The international pressure and economic sanctions could serve as incentives for a future leader to distance themselves from Putin's legacy and gain legitimacy.

While the probability of a "Yes" outcome is influenced by the potential for unforeseen events and leadership changes, the current status quo and strong domestic control suggest a higher likelihood of continuity in policies. Nonetheless, the possibility of a significant political shift remains, given the time frame and the mounting costs of the war.
