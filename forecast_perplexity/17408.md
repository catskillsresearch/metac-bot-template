# Comprehensive Analysis: US Court Decisions on AI Training Data Litigation

As of May 26, 2025, the question of whether a US court will fine or order a company to pay ≥$100M to claimants specifically for AI training data usage before 2026 requires careful analysis of current litigation, legal precedents, and market trends.

## Current Status of GitHub Copilot Litigation

The GitHub Copilot lawsuit, filed in November 2022 as a class-action against Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI, represents the most significant legal challenge to AI training data practices to date. As of July 2024, Judge Jon S. Tigar dismissed the majority of claims in the lawsuit, including key allegations related to violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

The case is currently proceeding on only two counts:
- Breach of contract
- Open-source license violations

This ruling represents a significant setback for the plaintiffs, who originally sought $1 billion in damages. The judge specifically determined that "the code snippets provided by GitHub Copilot to users are not similar enough to copyright-protected codes created by the plaintiffs" to violate the DMCA.

## Legal Timeline and Procedural Considerations

With just over 7 months remaining until the end of 2025, several timeline factors make a $100M+ judgment before the deadline less likely:

- Complex litigation typically takes years to resolve, especially when involving novel legal questions
- The dismissal of most claims has significantly narrowed the scope for potential damages
- Even on an expedited schedule, the remaining claims would require extensive discovery, class certification, and potentially a trial
- Any significant judgment would likely face appeals that would extend beyond December 2025

## Factors Weighing Against a $100M+ Judgment

1. **Limited Remaining Claims**: With only breach of contract and license violation claims remaining, the scope for massive damages has been substantially reduced.

2. **Judicial Skepticism**: The dismissal of DMCA claims suggests judicial skepticism about applying traditional copyright frameworks to AI training.

3. **Legal Novelty**: Courts tend to move cautiously in novel areas of law, and the intersection of AI, copyright, and open-source licensing represents uncharted legal territory.

4. **Burden of Proof**: The plaintiffs would need to demonstrate both that the remaining claims have merit and that the damages reach the $100M threshold, which is a substantial hurdle.

## Potential Pathways to a Large Judgment

Despite these challenges, several scenarios could lead to a ≥$100M judgment or settlement:

1. **Settlement Possibility**: The defendants might opt to settle the remaining claims for a significant amount to avoid protracted litigation and establish clear boundaries for their business models.

2. **Other Lawsuits**: While the GitHub Copilot case has received significant attention, other lawsuits against AI companies could potentially move faster and result in large judgments. For example, The New York Times has sued Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging they used "millions" of its copyrighted articles to train their AI models without consent.

3. **Judicial Interpretation**: A judge could interpret open-source license violations broadly, potentially leading to significant damages calculations if applied to millions of instances of copyrighted code.

## Relevant Legal Precedent

In February 2025, a Delaware federal court issued the first major decision concerning the use of copyrighted material to train AI. In Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. ROSS Intelligence Inc., the court granted Thomson Reuters's partial motion for summary judgment on its direct infringement claim and rejected Ross's fair use defense.

Importantly, the court noted that Ross's AI was "not generative AI" but rather a competing legal research tool that serves the same purpose as Westlaw. The court found that Ross used Westlaw headnotes to build a competing product, weighing against fair use.

While this case is distinct from generative AI applications, it provides some insight into how courts may analyze fair use defenses in AI training data cases. Judge Bibas himself noted: "I note for readers that only non-generative AI is before me today".

## Market Adaptation and Industry Response

The technology sector is already adapting to the legal uncertainty surrounding AI training data:

- Companies like OpenAI have begun making deals with media groups to properly license content for training
- The AI licensing market is projected to expand from $10 billion in 2025 to $67.5 billion by 2030
- Investors are backing startups that help creative industries license their content to AI groups

This adaptation suggests that the industry recognizes the legal risks and is taking steps to mitigate them, potentially reducing the likelihood of major adverse judgments.

## Conclusion

Given the current status of the GitHub Copilot litigation, the dismissal of most claims, the typically slow pace of complex litigation, and the industry's movement toward licensing models, it appears unlikely that a US court will order a company to pay ≥$100M to claimants specifically for AI training data usage before the end of 2025.

The most plausible path to such an outcome would be a settlement driven by business considerations rather than a court judgment. However, with the weakened case against GitHub/Microsoft/OpenAI, the defendants may feel less pressure to settle for a large amount. While other lawsuits like The New York Times case against Microsoft and OpenAI exist, there's limited evidence that they will progress rapidly enough to result in a large judgment before the end of 2025.
