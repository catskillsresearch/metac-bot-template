The regulatory environment surrounding Soylent-like meal replacements currently suggests a low likelihood of these products being labeled as unhealthy by 2030. Both the FDA and EFSA have not issued specific guidelines or bans targeting these products, indicating that the status quo is one of acceptance under general food safety standards. These agencies are typically reactive, requiring substantial evidence of harm before implementing regulatory changes. While there is an absence of long-term safety data, which introduces some risk of unforeseen nutritional deficiencies, no significant evidence or incidents have emerged to prompt immediate concern. The market for meal replacements is expanding, reflecting consumer acceptance and a lack of widespread health issues associated with their use. Unless compelling new research or a public health incident reveals significant health risks or nutritional inadequacies, it is likely that the current regulatory stance will remain unchanged.
