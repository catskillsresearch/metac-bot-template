The future of nuclear fission power in the US energy mix by 2050 is subject to various factors, including technological advancements, policy decisions, public perception, and global events. Currently, nuclear power accounts for about 8.5% of US energy production, with a potential increase to 10-12% if current trends continue.

Experts and markets generally expect nuclear's share to remain stable or increase slightly, with some projecting significant growth if favorable policies and technologies are implemented. There is cautious optimism in the market, with investments being made in both traditional and advanced nuclear technologies.

The development of small modular reactor (SMR) technology could be a game-changer for the industry. If successful, SMRs could dramatically reduce costs and construction times, making nuclear power more competitive and easier to deploy. Additionally, potential breakthroughs in fusion power could revolutionize the energy landscape, though this remains speculative given the current state of fusion research.

Climate change concerns and energy security issues may drive increased support for nuclear power as a low-carbon baseload energy source. Geopolitical tensions could further accelerate the push for domestic energy production, potentially benefiting nuclear power.

However, the industry faces significant challenges. Public perception and safety concerns remain major hurdles, particularly in the wake of past nuclear accidents. A future major nuclear incident could lead to widespread opposition and policy reversals, potentially resulting in the rapid decommissioning of existing plants.

Competition from other energy sources, particularly renewables, will play a crucial role. Advancements in renewable energy technologies and energy storage solutions could potentially reduce the need for nuclear power as a baseload energy source.

Given these factors and the long time horizon, the future of nuclear fission power in the US energy mix is highly uncertain. While there is potential for growth, there are also significant risks and challenges that could lead to a decline in nuclear's share of energy production.
