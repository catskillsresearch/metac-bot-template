# Assessing the Legal Future of Real-Money Prediction Markets in the US

The legal status of real-money prediction markets in the United States remains highly restricted as of May 2025, with neither Polymarket nor Manifold currently permitted to offer real-money betting to US customers. For this situation to change before the end of 2025, a significant legal or regulatory shift would need to occur in the remaining seven months of the year.

## Current Regulatory Landscape

The prediction market ecosystem in the US faces substantial barriers at both federal and state levels. Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2022 and ordered to cease noncompliant trading in the US. This enforcement action established a precedent that continues to shape the market. As of now, Polymarket remains technically illegal for US residents, while Manifold only operates with play money.

Multiple states—including Illinois, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, and Ohio—have issued cease-and-desist orders directing prediction markets to halt operations. This state-level resistance creates additional obstacles beyond federal regulation. The Nevada Gaming Control Board, for instance, recently demanded that even CFTC-approved platform Kalshi cease operations within the state, arguing that offering "event-based contracts" without proper gaming licenses violates state law.

## Recent Developments and Limited Progress

While some movement has occurred in the prediction market space, it has been narrow and platform-specific:

1. Kalshi has made limited legal progress, operating as the only CFTC-approved prediction market and securing a favorable ruling from the DC Circuit Court in October 2024.

2. The CFTC, under Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham, has expressed interest in "taking a forward-looking approach" to prediction markets and has planned roundtable discussions to gather public input.

3. Polymarket continues to operate internationally with significant betting volume, demonstrating strong market interest despite regulatory challenges.

However, these developments fall far short of creating a clear legal pathway for Polymarket or Manifold to operate with real money in the US. Kalshi's victories are specific to its platform and particular contract types, not extending to other market operators by default.

## Potential Paths to Legalization

For real-money betting on Polymarket or Manifold to become legal in the US during 2025, one of these scenarios would need to materialize:

1. **Federal Regulatory Shift**: The CFTC issues a no-action letter or new regulatory framework specifically addressing these platforms.

2. **Judicial Decision**: A federal court ruling broadly permits prediction markets or specifically grants Polymarket or Manifold permission to operate.

3. **Legislative Action**: New legislation at either federal or state level creates a clear legal pathway for these platforms.

4. **State-Level Authorization**: A state passes legislation or regulations explicitly permitting prediction markets, and one of these platforms receives a license or exemption.

Each of these paths faces significant challenges. The regulatory machinery moves slowly, particularly in financial markets. Court cases typically take years to resolve fully, and even favorable preliminary rulings face appeals and further litigation. Legislative action on niche financial products rarely proceeds quickly, especially without broad bipartisan support.

## Weighing the Evidence

Several factors suggest continued restrictions through 2025:

1. **Ongoing Enforcement**: Both federal and state regulators continue to actively enforce restrictions against prediction markets.

2. **Platform-Specific Advances**: Legal victories have been limited to Kalshi and specific contract types, not extending to the broader market.

3. **Regulatory Caution**: The CFTC has shown interest in reviewing its approach but has not signaled imminent approval for new platforms.

4. **State-Level Obstacles**: Even with favorable federal treatment, state gaming regulators present substantial barriers to nationwide operation.

5. **No Imminent Changes**: There are no public indications of pending CFTC guidance, court rulings, or legislative acts that would explicitly legalize real-money markets for Polymarket or Manifold in the immediate future.

The status quo strongly favors continued restriction of these platforms in the US market. Without a clear and public change in law or policy specifically permitting Polymarket or Manifold to offer real-money betting, they will remain effectively prohibited for US customers through 2025.
