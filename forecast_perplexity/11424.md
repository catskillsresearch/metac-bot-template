Andrew Yang is a nationally recognized political entrepreneur and activist, best known for his 2020 Democratic presidential run and subsequent 2021 New York City mayoral campaign, both of which ended in defeat. After these unsuccessful bids, Yang left the Democratic Party in 2021, citing frustration with its polarization, and launched the Forward Party as a centrist alternative, advocating for reforms such as ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries in hopes of creating more viable pathways for third-party candidates. 

The U.S. political system, however, is structurally resistant to the emergence and success of third parties, especially at the federal level. Historical precedent overwhelmingly shows that high federal office—such as U.S. Representative, Senator, Speaker of the House, Vice President, or President—is rarely attained by candidates outside the two dominant parties. Notable exceptions, like Senators Bernie Sanders and Angus King, typically began with strong local bases or aligned with a major party to secure electoral viability. The major-party duopoly is reinforced by first-past-the-post voting, restrictive ballot access laws, and entrenched party infrastructure.

Yang’s Forward Party, despite his national profile and energetic advocacy, has not demonstrated significant electoral traction or organizational power at the federal level as of mid-2025. Widespread electoral reforms that could substantially improve third-party prospects—such as universal adoption of ranked-choice voting—remain limited in reach and would require major, coordinated efforts and political will that is not evident at the scale or speed required to impact the 2037 timeframe. 

While Yang maintains a degree of public visibility, retains fundraising capability, and could in theory return to a major party as a candidate, there is no current indication of a credible campaign or concrete plan for him to pursue high federal office. His efforts have been more focused on systemic reform and building a political movement than on preparing for another personal run. The Forward Party’s immediate strategy is centered on long-term change rather than immediate electoral wins, and Yang’s recent public statements and activities support this orientation.

Major political realignments or extraordinary circumstances—such as a crisis driving widespread adoption of electoral reforms, or a unique unity ticket with a major party—could conceivably create an unexpected pathway. However, such events are historically rare, and the slow pace of institutional change in the U.S. suggests that the base rate for success under these scenarios remains very low.

In summary, the combination of persistent structural barriers, Yang’s electoral track record, the formidable challenge facing new parties, and the lack of clear and immediate opportunities for breakthrough converge to make the likelihood of Andrew Yang holding high federal office before February 1, 2037, extremely small. While volatility and surprises are not impossible in U.S. politics, and Yang’s ongoing advocacy may keep him in the public arena, the systemic obstacles and current trends significantly outweigh these possibilities.
