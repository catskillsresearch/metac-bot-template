# Earthquake Fatality Analysis for 2020-2029: Current Status and Future Risks

As of June 2025, approximately 4.5 years remain until the end of the forecast period (January 1, 2030). The deadliest earthquake recorded in the 2020-2029 period thus far is the March 28, 2025 Myanmar earthquake, with a confirmed death toll of approximately 3,740 according to national government reports.

## Current Situation Assessment

The Myanmar earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.7, caused significant destruction across Myanmar and parts of Thailand. The confirmed death toll has risen steadily from initial reports of around 1,000 deaths, which is typical as more remote areas are accessed and additional bodies are recovered. While early estimates from some sources suggested potential deaths exceeding 10,000 or even 100,000 in worst-case scenarios, the actual confirmed deaths have been significantly lower.

If current trends continue and no additional major earthquakes occur, we might expect the final Myanmar earthquake death toll to stabilize in the range of 4,000-5,000 deaths. This is consistent with the pattern of increasing confirmed deaths as recovery efforts continue in remote areas.

## Historical Context and Risk Factors

For comparison, the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake caused approximately 60,000 deaths, while the 2010 Haiti earthquake resulted in approximately 100,000 deaths. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused nearly 16,000 deaths despite Japan's advanced preparedness.

Several key factors influence earthquake fatality rates:

- **Building codes and construction quality**: Countries with poor building standards typically experience higher fatalities
- **Population density**: Urban areas generally see higher casualty rates
- **Time of day**: Nighttime earthquakes often result in more fatalities
- **Earthquake characteristics**: Larger, shallower earthquakes typically cause more damage
- **Secondary effects**: Tsunamis, landslides, and fires can significantly increase the death toll

## Potential Future Scenarios

With approximately 4.5 years remaining in the decade, there is still potential for a more deadly earthquake:

### Low-End Scenario
If seismic activity remains at typical or below-average levels, and any moderate/large earthquakes occur in well-prepared, lower-density, or less vulnerable regions (e.g., California, Japan), the final death toll could remain close to the current Myanmar figure, i.e., near 4,000.

### Moderate Scenario
A significant earthquake (magnitude 7.0+) striking a moderately populated area with mixed building standards could result in fatalities in the 10,000-30,000 range. This would exceed the Myanmar event but remain well below historical catastrophes.

### High-End Scenario
An unprecedented event—such as a magnitude 8+ quake striking an underprepared, densely populated metropolis in South Asia, Southeast Asia, or a Pacific coastal region with poor infrastructure and limited emergency response—could cause tens of thousands or even over 100,000 deaths.

Of particular concern are:
- **Japan's Nankai Trough**: Government estimates suggest a potential death toll of 300,000 in a worst-case scenario, though Japan's preparedness would likely mitigate this significantly
- **Istanbul, Turkey**: Studies indicate significant risk in this densely populated area
- **Parts of South Asia**: Densely populated cities with variable building standards

## Risk Distribution

| Scenario      | Estimated Deaths | Likelihood     |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Current trend | 4,000 - 5,000    | High           |
| Major event   | 10,000 - 30,000  | Moderate       |
| Catastrophic  | 30,000 - 100,000 | Low            |
| Mega-disaster | 100,000+         | Very low       |

Earthquake fatality forecasting is subject to "fat tails": large, rare disasters are extremely hard to predict, and preliminary death tolls can be revised significantly for years after a disaster, especially in regions with poor reporting infrastructure. This necessitates wide probability distributions when forecasting maximum death tolls.

The most likely outcome remains that the Myanmar earthquake (with a final toll around 4,000-5,000) will be the deadliest of the decade, but there is a small yet significant probability of a much deadlier event occurring before 2030.
