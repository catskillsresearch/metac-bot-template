## Rationale for Assessing Whether Russia Will Repel Ukrainian Forces from the Kursk Region Before June 30, 2025

The situation in Russia’s Kursk Oblast remains highly contested, marked by ongoing active combat operations as of late May 2025. Ukrainian forces, having launched their initial incursion into the region in August 2024, retain a presence within Kursk, though Russia has regained control over the majority of previously lost territory. Recent weeks have witnessed significant military engagements, including a major Ukrainian assault on the settlement of Tetkino, which reportedly involved extensive use of armored vehicles and attack aircraft. Russian sources claim to have repelled these attempts, inflicting heavy losses on Ukrainian equipment and personnel, yet fighting persists in the area, underscoring Ukraine’s ongoing operational capability and initiative.

Despite Russia’s recapture of most territory and the redeployment of much of its “Kursk army” toward other fronts, particularly Kharkiv, Ukrainian operations—both ground assaults and increased precision drone attacks on Russian logistics and command nodes—continue to challenge Russian control in the region. The fluid nature of the frontlines is evident, with both sides making incremental gains and neither achieving undisputed dominance over the entirety of Kursk Oblast.

Strategically, Russia maintains a numerical and logistical advantage, having dedicated substantial resources to the region. The redeployment of Russian troops from Kursk to other areas may signal growing confidence in achieving the objective of expelling Ukrainian forces. However, this shift also introduces potential vulnerabilities if Ukrainian troops can exploit any temporary dilution of Russian presence.

Several key factors shape the outlook for the coming weeks:

- **Operational Momentum and Resources:** Russian forces have demonstrated the ability to reclaim territory and apply sustained pressure. Their force superiority and logistical advantages improve prospects for a complete expulsion if current trends persist. However, the pace of clearance may slow as resources are redirected and as Ukrainian defenses stiffen in remaining pockets.

- **Ukrainian Defensive Resilience:** Ukraine has shown a capacity to establish and hold fortified positions even under heavy pressure, and continues to mount both defensive and offensive operations inside Kursk. The persistence of Ukrainian raids and limited territorial holdings—especially if recognized on operational maps such as those by DeepStateMap or ISW—means that even a minimal Ukrainian presence could prevent a “Yes” resolution until the very end of the window.

- **Status Quo and Mapping Criteria:** The resolution of this question depends strictly on the publicly acknowledged territorial control indicated by reputable mapping sources. Even isolated Ukrainian positions or small incursions could suffice to delay Russia’s full expulsion if such positions remain visible on these maps.

- **Timeframe and Strategic Priorities:** With just over five weeks left until the June 30 deadline, Russia possesses a reasonable window to complete clearing operations. Nonetheless, the possibility remains that entrenched or flexible Ukrainian positions persist, particularly if shifting Russian priorities favor other fronts or if unexpected developments alter the operational tempo.

- **Uncertainties:** The ability or willingness of Ukraine to reinforce or tactically withdraw, the intensity and effectiveness of Russian clearing operations, and potential escalations elsewhere all inject uncertainty into the forecast. The “world changes slowly” principle applies; unless a clear breakthrough or collapse occurs, the status quo—where some Ukrainian presence remains—may persist longer than anticipated.

In summary, while Russia currently holds the operational initiative and has made substantial gains, Ukrainian resistance remains active. A complete Russian clearing of Ukrainian forces from Kursk before June 30, 2025, is plausible and supported by recent trends, but is not certain. The final outcome will hinge on Russia’s ability to overcome entrenched Ukrainian positions within the available time and on mapping updates by credible sources. The trajectory favors Russian success, but persistent Ukrainian activity and operational uncertainties mean the outcome is not foregone.
