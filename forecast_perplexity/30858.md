# U.S. Per Capita Chicken Consumption in 2025: A Comprehensive Analysis

The U.S. chicken consumption landscape continues to evolve, with several key factors influencing the projected per capita consumption for 2025. Based on current data and market trends, we can develop a robust understanding of where consumption is heading.

## Current Consumption Trajectory

The most recent official data shows that Americans consumed 101.0-101.2 pounds of chicken per capita in 2023-2024. This continues the long-term upward trend in chicken consumption that has characterized American dietary patterns for decades. Chicken remains the most consumed animal protein in the United States, significantly outpacing beef and pork.

## Official Forecasts and Production Outlook

The National Chicken Council forecasts total chicken consumption at 108 pounds per capita for 2025, with broiler consumption specifically at 102.4 pounds. This aligns closely with USDA projections, which forecast broiler meat consumption at 103.1 pounds per capita for 2025. 

Broiler meat production is expected to increase by approximately 1% to 47.1 billion pounds in 2025, driven by:

- Lower feed costs improving production efficiency
- Higher prices for competing meats
- Steadily increasing average live bird weights

However, this production growth may be somewhat constrained by a layer flock that was 4% lower on January 1, 2025, compared to the previous year, as well as hatching rates that continue to recover back to historical averages.

## Market Dynamics Favoring Chicken

Several key market factors are supporting increased chicken consumption:

1. **Price advantage**: Chicken maintains a significant price advantage over beef and pork, with beef prices reported to exceed $8.60 per pound in some markets, driving consumer substitution toward chicken.

2. **Competing protein prices**: Total red meat and poultry per capita consumption in 2025 is projected at 228.5 pounds, down slightly from 229 pounds in 2024. While overall meat consumption may decrease slightly, chicken's share is expected to grow.

3. **Production efficiency**: Lower feed costs are benefiting all livestock sectors but particularly favor chicken production with its superior feed conversion ratio.

## Potential Disruption Factors

The forecast could be impacted by several potential disruptions:

1. **Disease risk**: A significant outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) could severely disrupt production. The poultry industry has already faced HPAI challenges affecting egg production, and if it spreads more widely to broiler flocks, it could reduce chicken availability and increase prices.

2. **Export challenges**: U.S. broiler meat exports for 2025 are forecast to decrease 2% to 6.61 billion pounds, following a 7% decline in 2024 exports. This export weakness is due to strong price competition from other major exporters, particularly Brazil.

3. **Economic conditions**: A significant economic downturn could reduce overall meat consumption, though chicken typically fares better than more expensive proteins during economic challenges.

## Potential Upside Scenario

If beef and pork prices increase more dramatically than expected, consumers might shift even more aggressively toward chicken as the affordable protein alternative. Combined with successful expansion of ready-to-eat chicken products and strong retail promotions, this could drive chicken consumption above current forecasts, potentially pushing toward or above 110 pounds per capita.
