A review of recent hydrological data reveals that the River Avon at Bath Destructor Bridge is experiencing an unusually high water level for late May, measured at 4.52 meters—significantly above the local “normal” range for this location. The south-west of England, including Bath, currently stands as an exception to the national pattern of declining river levels, with regional data and weather reports indicating that this area has retained higher flows than much of the rest of the UK, where conditions are trending toward drought and below-normal flows.

Historically, river levels in this region exhibit seasonal declines from spring into summer as rainfall typically lessens and evaporation increases. The usual pattern would see the river falling gradually back toward the normal summer range by July. However, the current starting point is exceptionally elevated for this time of year. Such a significant drop into the normal range, or even to low levels, over a one-month period would generally require sustained dry and warm weather or major changes in water management—outcomes that, while possible, are not currently predicted by available meteorological data.

The persistence of more robust regional flows in the south-west, as indicated by national and regional reporting, provides inertia that could keep the river at elevated levels even as the broader national trend is downward. That said, river systems are dynamic and can respond rapidly to unseasonal shifts in weather, including both extended dry spells and sudden heavy rainfall. Localized events—such as infrastructural interventions or unexpected operational changes—could accelerate changes in river level, although such events are rare.

Given this context, the most probable scenario is a moderate decline in the river level toward the normal range, consistent with seasonal patterns. However, the currently high level leaves significant probability that the river may not return fully to normal by July 1, especially if the rate of decline is slower than average or if the region remains wetter than forecast. Conversely, a scenario involving abrupt, extreme drying could force the river level below normal, but this is considerably less likely given both regional patterns and the current surplus.

In summary, the forecast must account for:

- The notably high river level as of late May, which is rare for this time of year;
- The typical seasonal drawdown toward summer, but starting from an unusually high position;
- Regional hydrological resilience, as south-west England is insulated from the national trend of rapidly falling river levels;
- The potential, though limited, for extreme weather or operational interventions to cause an unexpected shift either above or below the anticipated range.

Thus, while gradual reversion toward normal remains the baseline expectation, both elevated and sharply reduced water levels are possible under plausible, though less likely, scenarios.
