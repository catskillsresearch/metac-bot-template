The current regulatory environment in China is highly restrictive regarding nonmedical embryo selection, including for intelligence. This is reinforced by strict government regulations and a strong response to previous attempts at genetic enhancement, such as the CRISPR babies incident. The scientific and ethical debates surrounding polygenic prediction of intelligence remain contentious, and there is no existing operational or regulatory infrastructure to support large-scale embryo selection for intelligence. 

While China possesses the technological capability and an advanced biotechnology sector, significant ethical, scientific, and regulatory barriers exist. The status quo outcome, given these conditions, is a No. However, the long time horizon until 2300 introduces uncertainty. Over this period, potential scenarios could lead to a Yes outcome, such as a significant policy shift driven by changes in leadership, societal values, technological advancements, or geopolitical pressures. These changes could lead to the relaxation of regulations and the development of a robust framework to support intelligence-based embryo selection.

Despite these possibilities, the world generally changes slowly, and overcoming the substantial barriers to large-scale intelligence-based embryo selection would require significant shifts in policy, public acceptance, and scientific advancements. Therefore, while future technological and societal changes could alter the current trajectory, the current environment does not support the likelihood of China being the first country to select more than 10% of its newborns for intelligence.
