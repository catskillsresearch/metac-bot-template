The US dollar’s share of global foreign currency exchange reserves has experienced a slow, persistent decline—falling from about 65% in 2014 to 57.4% as of Q3 2024. This translates to an average drop of roughly 0.7–1 percentage points per year. At this rate, projections suggest the dollar will remain above 50% through Q3 2028, barring a dramatic shift in trends.

The dollar’s dominance is underpinned by several structural factors. US financial markets are the deepest and most liquid globally, making dollar-denominated assets highly attractive for central banks that prioritize liquidity, safety, and legal certainty. The entrenched network effects of the dollar remain powerful: a significant proportion of global trade, commodities, and financial contracts is still conducted in dollars. No competing currency is positioned to challenge this dominance in the near term. The euro faces economic and political fragmentation in the Eurozone, the Chinese renminbi suffers from capital controls and a lack of full convertibility, and other major currencies and alternatives like gold lack the necessary scale and trust.

Institutional inertia also plays a significant role. Central banks tend to be conservative in their reserve management, favoring gradual adjustments over abrupt shifts, which helps maintain the dollar’s share even when there are political motivations to diversify. The risk-averse nature of reserve managers means that, even amid ongoing talk of de-dollarization and efforts by blocs like BRICS to create or promote alternatives, concrete changes to the global reserve mix have been incremental. Progress in establishing credible, scalable replacements—such as gold-backed digital currencies or expanded local currency trade among BRICS—has been slow and fragmented.

Risks that could accelerate a decline below the 50% threshold do exist, but would require a sharp break from historical patterns. These risks include a dramatic loss of confidence in US fiscal or monetary management brought on by a debt crisis, US default, or runaway inflation; a rapid, coordinated sell-off of dollar assets by large holders; or a technological breakthrough enabling widespread, efficient cross-border settlement in non-dollar assets. The use of the dollar as a tool of foreign policy—particularly through sanctions—has also motivated some countries to explore alternatives, but so far the impact on the aggregate reserve composition has been modest.

Notably, periods of global instability, such as economic downturns or geopolitical crises, often boost demand for dollars due to their "safe haven" status, counteracting de-dollarization efforts. Even recent U.S. policy uncertainty, including protectionist measures and rising debt levels, has primarily resulted in warnings from analysts about risks to dollar dominance rather than evidence of imminent, large-scale exits from the currency.

Consensus among leading institutions and experts reflects the resilience of the dollar’s reserve status. Reports from the World Economic Forum and other organizations indicate that “the US dollar is likely to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future, given strong US fundamentals, a lack of credible alternatives and its powerful and entrenched network effects.” Central banks, as stewards of national reserves, continue to prioritize the stability, liquidity, and trust offered by the US dollar.

In summary, despite gradual de-dollarization and geopolitical pressures, the US dollar’s dominant role in global reserves is likely to persist above the 50% threshold through Q3 2028. A sustained drop below this level would require an unprecedented acceleration in diversification away from the dollar, which current market conditions, alternatives, and institutional behaviors do not support.
