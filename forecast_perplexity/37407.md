Keir Starmer's approval rating has reached historic lows in late May 2025, with just 23% of Britons viewing him favorably and a net favorability of -46, his worst ever recorded. This decline is not only broad-based but has also affected his core Labour supporters, with even half of Labour voters now holding an unfavorable opinion of him. The downward trend is driven by widespread public dissatisfaction, negative media coverage, and the rising appeal of opposition parties such as Reform UK under Nigel Farage.

In contrast, Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba’s most recent available approval rating, from March 2025, also showed a sharp decline to a record low of 26% following a political scandal involving the distribution of gift vouchers[The Star]. Despite this, no further major scandals or substantial negative developments have been reported for Ishiba since then. Recent Japanese news has focused on Ishiba’s efforts to promote economic growth and wage increases, suggesting some potential for stabilization or modest recovery in his approval, but without new quantitative polling numbers.

Given these circumstances, the status quo clearly favors Ishiba holding a higher approval rating than Starmer: Starmer’s approval is at an all-time low and still falling, while Ishiba, though also unpopular, appears to have stabilized after his scandal, with no evidence his rating fell below Starmer’s 23%. Approval ratings for political leaders within a one-month time frame—especially when they are already so low—tend to be relatively stable unless triggered by major policy victories, unforeseen crises, or scandals. For Starmer to overtake Ishiba in approval would require either a rapid, significant improvement in his popularity (such as a highly visible policy success or positive international event) or a new, serious setback for Ishiba that drives his numbers below Starmer’s already severe unpopularity. Both developments are possible, but absent strong evidence suggesting such movement is imminent, inertia and current trends are likely to persist.

In summary, both leaders are facing domestic discontent, but Starmer’s historic unpopularity and lack of positive momentum make it highly likely that his approval rating will remain below Ishiba’s by July 1, 2025. Only the emergence of an unexpected, transformative event in the next month could plausibly reverse this dynamic.
