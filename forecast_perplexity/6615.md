Alcor currently shows stable financial health with a conservative, trust‐fund based model that makes near‐term bankruptcy highly unlikely. In the coming decades—perhaps the next 10 to 30 years—the organization is expected to continue operations without incident, and no revival of any preserved patient appears imminent given the extraordinarily slow progress required for the necessary technological breakthroughs. However, the prospect of reviving a cryopreserved patient, whether through advanced biomedical repair or whole‐brain emulation, remains a highly speculative and very distant possibility—even on a timescale of centuries.

Given that the breakthrough needed to reverse cryopreservation is both uncertain and likely far in the future, the cumulative risk over such extended periods becomes significant. Over many decades or centuries, a range of unforeseen factors—such as economic downturns, regulatory shifts, mismanagement of trust funds, or other catastrophic events—could erode the organization's long‐term viability. Even a well‐managed institution with solid assets today might eventually face a scenario where it goes bankrupt before any of its patients is revived.

In summary, while the current status quo supports near‐term financial stability, the extreme delay anticipated for any successful revival, combined with the cumulative long‐term risks, suggests that adverse events eventually could undercut Alcor’s solvency, resulting in bankruptcy prior to any breakthrough in reviving its patients.
