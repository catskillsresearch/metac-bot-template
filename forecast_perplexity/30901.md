The outcome of the Gary Marcus–Miles Brundage bet on AI capabilities at the end of 2027 is most likely to be decided by the incremental nature of technological progress, the stringency of the bet’s criteria, and the current status of AI research.

As of mid-2025, AI systems cannot reliably perform most of the ten highly ambitious tasks specified in the bet. These include producing creative works at the level of Pulitzer- or Oscar-winning humans, generating paradigm-shifting scientific discoveries, or autonomously creating bug-free 10,000+ line code from natural language without expert assistance. Even the most advanced models still struggle with long-term reasoning, creativity, and robust performance in open-ended and context-rich domains.

Expert consensus and prediction markets consistently indicate that AI is unlikely to achieve at least 8 of the 10 tasks by the deadline. The majority of AI researchers and forecasters expect only steady, incremental advances over the next two and a half years, with existing bottlenecks in reasoning, abstraction, and autonomous creativity remaining unresolved at least through 2027. The high bar set by the bet requires not just competence but true, human-expert-level excellence and contextual understanding with minimal human involvement—standards that are not even consistently met by domain experts, making the prospect of near-term AI success far less plausible.

Nonetheless, forecasters acknowledge the field’s history of sudden, transformative breakthroughs, and the massive resources and competitive pressure currently accelerating AI research. While the central expectation remains that progress will be gradual, not discontinuous, there is a nonzero but minority probability—perhaps due to an unforeseen paradigm shift, such as a successful neurosymbolic approach or another radical architecture—that AI could rapidly overcome its outstanding limitations. If such a leap were to occur, it could enable AI to achieve the required creative, scientific, and technical feats before the end of 2027.

Subjectivity and ambiguity in judging whether tasks have been genuinely “solved” add further uncertainty, but the rules require mutual agreement on resolution, reducing the risk of disputes or premature announcements.

In summary, the most likely scenario is that Gary Marcus wins the bet, on the strength of current trends and historical patterns in AI progress. However, the unpredictable nature of research breakthroughs requires assigning some weight to low-probability, high-impact developments that could still alter the outcome. The final result ultimately hinges on whether AI can clear a constellation of “best-in-human-history” achievements in a remarkably short time—a challenge that most experts believe will remain unmet in the near term.
