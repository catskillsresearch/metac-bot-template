Alcor has consistently structured its cryopreservation protocols around vitrification without the use of chemical fixatives, such as glutaraldehyde. This position is deeply rooted in Alcor's mission to preserve biological viability, maintaining the theoretical possibility of future biological revival for its members. The organization’s official statements and strategic planning documents, including a 2021 roadmap and ongoing research updates through 2025, continue to emphasize improving vitrification by minimizing toxicity and ischemic injury, not introducing fixatives. 

The rationale behind this stance derives from the core philosophical belief that fixatives, while offering remarkable structural preservation, effectively destroy biological viability—a primary objective for most Alcor members. This view is reinforced by expert opinion within the field: notably, the lead developer of Aldehyde-Stabilized Cryopreservation (ASC) recommended against its adoption in cryonics, and Alcor’s 2018 public statement explicitly cautioned that the irreversible effects of fixatives are incompatible with their revival-centric mission. 

Although ASC and similar approaches have received scientific accolades for achieving superior ultrastructural preservation—drawing interest for applications like brain banking and research—the tradeoff is significant: fixatives lock down molecular structure at the expense of all biological function. For Alcor’s clientele, who typically value the prospect of whole-person or brain revival, fixative-based methods have thus been viewed as a non-starter. Only a paradigmatic shift in scientific consensus—for example, compelling evidence that fixatives could be reversed or that digital replication (“mind uploading”) becomes widely accepted as a goal—or overwhelming member demand could prompt Alcor to reconsider this position.

Despite ongoing progress in the broader fields of cryopreservation and biobanking, and increasing global interest in various preservation methods, Alcor’s statements and research investments show no pivot toward incorporating fixatives. Their adoption would not only require technical advances but also a deep philosophical and organizational reorientation. Significant inertia persists: changes in such high-stakes, identity-defining matters tend to be slow, and Alcor’s leadership and membership remain aligned around the current revival-driven paradigm.

In summary, the likelihood of Alcor offering fixative-based cryopreservation prior to 2030 is constrained by a strong status quo bias, substantial philosophical barriers, and a continued focus on improving established vitrification techniques. Unless an unprecedented scientific, regulatory, or cultural shift occurs, Alcor is expected to maintain its current approach and not introduce a fixative option within this timeframe.
