The time frame for assessing the relative severity of the next US depression compared to the Great Depression extends until January 1, 2032, leaving approximately 6 years and 7 months for potential developments. Currently, no economic depression meeting the specified criteria has occurred, rendering the status quo outcome ambiguous. If current economic trends persist, it is unlikely that a depression of the specified severity will occur by 2032.

Experts and markets generally anticipate that economic cycles will continue without reaching depression-level severity. They estimate a 15-20% probability of a depression occurring within the specified timeframe, with a relative severity of 0.3-0.7 times that of the Great Depression if it does occur.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these expectations. On the low outcome side, a significant technological breakthrough or effective policy intervention could lead to unprecedented economic growth and stability, preventing any depression-level events. Conversely, a major geopolitical conflict or global financial crisis could trigger a severe and prolonged economic downturn, resulting in a depression with a severity comparable to or exceeding the Great Depression.
