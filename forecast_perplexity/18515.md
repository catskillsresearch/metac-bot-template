The current situation in Sweden suggests a high likelihood of a "Yes" outcome to the question of whether a terrorist attack will cause at least one death before 2031. This is primarily due to the February 2025 school shooting in Örebro, which resulted in multiple civilian deaths and has been described as a racist terrorist attack. Although the Swedish government or police have not officially classified it as such, the nature of the attack and its targeting of immigrants strongly suggest it could be recognized as terrorism.

The historical context and recent increase in threat levels in Sweden further support the potential for future attacks. Despite efforts to enhance security and reduce the threat level to "elevated," Sweden remains a prioritized target for terrorist activities due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and domestic radicalization. The possibility of another attack occurring before 2031 cannot be dismissed, especially given the country's status as a target for terrorist groups.

However, a scenario where no further attacks occur and the Örebro incident is not officially classified as terrorism could result in a "No" outcome. This would require effective counterterrorism measures, successful community engagement to prevent radicalization, and international cooperation to mitigate threats. Nonetheless, the existing incident already meets the criteria for a "Yes" outcome, making it the most likely result unless significant changes occur.
