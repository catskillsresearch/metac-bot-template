The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has already taken the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification as of May 22, 2025, effectively barring Harvard from enrolling new international students under F or M visas and requiring current foreign students to transfer or risk losing their legal status. This action was founded on DHS's claims that Harvard permitted an unsafe campus environment, including allegations of violence, antisemitism, and collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party. Harvard's leadership was specifically accused of facilitating and permitting activities deemed anti-American and pro-terrorist, with foreign students allegedly among those involved. 

The revocation followed a period of escalating conflict between DHS and Harvard. In April 2025, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem demanded extensive records from Harvard about alleged unlawful activities and misconduct by international students, warning that non-compliance could result in immediate loss of SEVP certification. DHS maintains that Harvard failed to comply with these demands, which was cited as a primary justification for the certification termination.

Harvard responded swiftly by publicly acknowledging the revocation and immediately seeking legal relief. On May 23, 2025, a federal court granted Harvard a temporary injunction, allowing the university to continue enrolling international students while litigation is ongoing. However, the technical criteria for determining whether SEVP certification has been revoked are satisfied by the DHS’s formal, effective action, regardless of court-ordered stays; the forecasted question explicitly states that a court intervention does not negate the fact of revocation if DHS’s action is enacted in defiance or remains in effect.

The broader context suggests this move is part of a pattern of aggressive immigration enforcement actions by the current administration, as evidenced by recent policy shifts affecting other groups. DHS’s framing of the Harvard action as a “warning to all universities and academic institutions” suggests the possibility of further action against other institutions, though, as of now, Harvard is the only Ivy League university to face such enforcement.

The only plausible scenario in which the question would resolve differently is if the revocation is completely reversed or invalidated—not merely paused—by September 1, 2025, and no other Ivy League institution is similarly targeted in the interim. However, as of May 25, 2025, the status is that DHS’s unprecedented action against Harvard has taken place and stands as the operative reality, with significant and immediate consequences for the university’s capacity to host international students.
