Multiple lines of evidence indicate that, as of 2025, the United States has experienced a strong and persistent pattern of two or more COVID-19 hospitalization waves per respiratory season since the start of the pandemic. This multi-wave pattern has included both a major winter peak and a distinct secondary surge—often occurring in summer or early autumn—across every season from 2020 through 2024. Notably, these waves have persisted even as influenza has surpassed COVID-19 as the leading cause of respiratory-related deaths and hospitalizations in some regions, and as public health measures and vaccination campaigns have shifted toward endemic management. The CDC and leading researchers continue to report that, unlike other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV, COVID-19 displays meaningful surge activity outside the typical winter season, and there is no scientific consensus supporting an imminent shift to a predictable, single-wave seasonal pattern.

The ongoing drivers behind multiple annual waves are threefold: continued evolution and emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune escape properties; waning immunity after vaccination or prior infection; and the virus’s demonstrated capacity for efficient year-round transmission. Even in 2025, the emergence of new variants like NB.1.8.1 has led to observable increases in cases and hospitalizations, illustrating the virus’s ongoing volatility and adaptability. Vaccination rates for updated COVID-19 boosters remain suboptimal, with recent CDC data showing that, as of late 2023, no more than 5% of hospitalized adults in any age category had received the updated 2023–2024 monovalent dose. These gaps in population immunity both increase susceptibility and the likelihood of periodic surges.

While there are plausible paths by which COVID-19 could transition to a more predictable, influenza-like seasonal pattern—most likely characterized by a single dominant winter peak—such a transition typically takes many years. Historical precedent from the 1918 influenza pandemic suggests that the establishment of stable, single-peak seasonality can require more than half a decade of post-pandemic adaptation. By the 2028–2029 respiratory seasons, COVID-19 will be eight to nine years into its pandemic-to-endemic transition, potentially approaching—but not necessarily having completed—this convergence. Expert panels, including those from the CDC and Johns Hopkins, continue to stress that the timing and likelihood of such a transition remain uncertain, with variant emergence and the waning of collective immunity likely to continue driving variability for the foreseeable future.

Importantly, the criteria for identifying a hospitalization wave peak are relative, meaning that even if the overall burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations decreases, distinct surges can still be detected so long as they are sufficiently separate from seasonal troughs. Surveillance systems and data quality, including those maintained by RESP-NET and the CDC, are expected to remain robust enough to track such patterns through at least the end of this decade.

Given this evidence, the most likely scenario is that at least one of the 2028 or 2029 respiratory disease seasons in the United States will exhibit two or more distinct COVID-19 hospitalization waves, due to the combined forces of partial immunity, ongoing viral evolution, and the established inertia of multi-peak seasonality. While a future convergence to a single, predictable seasonal wave is plausible, there is currently no compelling reason—epidemiological, immunological, or institutional—to expect this shift to occur so rapidly as to preclude multiple waves by the end of the decade.
