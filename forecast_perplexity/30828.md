Donald Trump has been repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, most recently in March 2025, primarily for his involvement in the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. The nomination process for the Nobel Peace Prize is accessible to a broad range of qualified individuals, so repeated nominations reflect ongoing interest among certain political circles but do not, on their own, signal a strong likelihood of selection.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee’s criteria emphasize sustained, transformative, and broadly recognized contributions to international peace. Historically, the committee has rewarded either longstanding efforts or major landmark achievements that are widely regarded as reducing conflict and fostering reconciliation. Only four U.S. presidents—Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama—have received the prize, typically after notable and highly publicized diplomatic milestones, and these awards have often attracted significant debate.

Trump remains publicly motivated to secure the prize, and there is evidence that this ambition continues to influence his foreign policy efforts, with new diplomatic initiatives in regions such as Ukraine, the Middle East, and among other major conflict zones. Supporters argue that his approach challenges traditional assumptions and his past achievements, like the Abraham Accords, demonstrate the potential for unconventional diplomacy to yield results recognized on the global stage.

Despite these efforts, the Nobel Committee’s decision-making process is affected by several factors that act as barriers to Trump’s selection. These include the committee’s sensitivity to political controversy and divisiveness, the competitive field of annual nominees (including humanitarian organizations and other political leaders), and the preference for clear, durable, and internationally acclaimed peace breakthroughs. Trump’s confrontational style, his public criticism of the committee, and the mixed legacy of his foreign policy are additional headwinds.

The status quo—where Trump is regularly nominated but not selected—remains dominant, primarily because, to date, none of his efforts have been viewed by the committee as sufficiently transformative or uncontested to justify awarding the prize. Nevertheless, the unpredictable nature of international relations means the possibility cannot be discounted entirely. If Trump were to broker a widely recognized and lasting peace agreement—such as a conclusive end to the Ukraine war, a transformative settlement in the Middle East, or another significant diplomatic achievement that garners broad international consensus—then the Nobel Committee could reconsider his candidacy.

In summary, while Trump’s profile and efforts ensure his continued relevance to Nobel Peace Prize discussions, his chances depend on achieving a historic, widely validated breakthrough in global peace that clearly meets the committee’s standards and overcomes existing reservations stemming from controversy and competition in the global peace landscape.
