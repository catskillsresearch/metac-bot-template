# Assessing the Likelihood of Extreme Global Warming Before 2100

The question of whether the world will experience a 5-year period with average global temperatures exceeding 3.6°C above pre-industrial levels (1861-1880 baseline) before 2100 requires careful analysis of current climate trajectories, scientific projections, and key uncertainty factors.

## Current Climate Trajectory

The world is already experiencing significant warming, with recent data showing that global temperatures have reached approximately 1.45°C above pre-industrial levels as of 2024-2025. The years 2023 and 2024 were among the hottest on record, with 2024 being the first year to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The World Meteorological Organization has warned that there is a 70% probability that the five-year average for 2025-2029 will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

This accelerating warming trend is particularly concerning as it suggests we may be on a trajectory toward the higher end of climate projections. Current policies in place around the world are projected to result in about 2.7°C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100. However, this represents the median estimate, with significant uncertainty in both directions.

## Emissions Pathways and Temperature Projections

Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those currently in place, global emissions are projected to continue rising. According to the Climate Action Tracker, current policies would lead to approximately 2.7°C warming by 2100. However, in high-emission scenarios, warming could reach between 3.3°C and 5.7°C by 2100. The IPCC's assessments suggest that baseline scenarios without additional mitigation would result in warming between 3.7°C and 4.8°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

Climate models show a "fat right tail" in temperature distributions, meaning there's a non-negligible probability of exceeding even the higher-end projections. While median warming might be around 3°C by 2100, the probability of exceeding 4°C or even reaching 6°C cannot be discounted, especially if climate sensitivity is higher than expected.

## Key Factors Influencing Future Warming

### Climate Sensitivity and Feedback Loops

The Earth's climate sensitivity (how much warming occurs from doubling CO2) remains a critical uncertainty. Recent evidence suggests that climate sensitivity may be in the upper half of the estimated range (2.5-4.5°C per doubling), which would push us toward higher warming outcomes.

Several feedback mechanisms could accelerate warming beyond current projections:

1. **Arctic Amplification**: The Arctic is already warming at more than three times the global average rate. This amplified warming could accelerate global climate change through reduced albedo and other feedback mechanisms.

2. **Permafrost Thawing**: As permafrost thaws, it releases methane and carbon dioxide, creating a positive feedback loop that further accelerates warming.

3. **Reduced Carbon Sink Efficiency**: Oceans and forests may become less effective at absorbing carbon as they warm and become saturated, potentially accelerating atmospheric CO2 increase.

4. **Cloud Cover Changes**: Alterations in cloud patterns and coverage could either amplify or dampen warming, adding uncertainty to projections.

### Emissions Trajectory

Despite international agreements, global emissions have not yet peaked, and many countries are still expanding fossil fuel infrastructure. Even with substantial mitigation efforts beginning soon, the inertia in the climate system means that warming will continue for decades.

The IPCC finds that there is a more than 50% chance that global temperature rise will reach or surpass 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 across studied scenarios. Under a high-emissions pathway, global temperature rise could increase to 3.3-5.7°C by 2100.

### Timing Considerations

For a 5-year period to exceed 3.6°C before 2100, warming would need to accelerate beyond current median projections. Given current emissions trajectories, it's reasonable to expect that:

- By 2050: Global temperatures could reach 2-2.5°C above pre-industrial levels
- By 2070-2080: Temperatures could approach or exceed 3°C
- By 2090-2100: Temperatures could reach or exceed 3.6°C

The question specifically asks about a 5-year period, not just end-of-century temperatures. This is important because natural variability means some periods will be warmer than the long-term trend, making the chance of crossing 3.6°C for at least one 5-year period higher than the chance of the long-term average exceeding this threshold.

## Barriers to Mitigation

The scale of emissions reductions needed to avoid exceeding 3.6°C is enormous and would require:

- Unprecedented international cooperation
- Rapid phase-out of fossil fuels
- Massive deployment of renewable energy
- Substantial negative emissions technologies
- Radical changes to transportation, industry, and agriculture

Current political and economic realities suggest these transformations are unlikely to occur at the speed and scale required. The window for limiting warming to levels below 3°C is rapidly closing. Each year of delayed action makes the required rate of emissions reduction steeper and eventually infeasible.

Even if countries achieved their climate pledges (nationally determined contributions or NDCs), research shows they would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by just 7% from 2019 levels by 2030, compared to the 43% reduction needed to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C.

## Concluding Assessment

To reach 3.6°C before 2100, we would need approximately 2.15°C additional warming beyond current levels over the next 75 years—an average warming rate of about 0.29°C per decade. This is certainly possible given current trajectories.

The most recent comprehensive climate projections suggest that under current policies and pledges, median warming will reach approximately 2.7-3.2°C by 2100. However, these are median estimates with considerable uncertainty ranges that extend well above 3.6°C.

When considering:
- High-emission scenarios projecting warming of 3.3-5.7°C by 2100
- The "fat right tail" of climate sensitivity distribution
- Recent observations suggesting warming may be occurring faster than previously modeled
- The possibility of reinforcing feedback mechanisms
- The fact that five-year averages will reach extremes before the end-of-century average

The likelihood of at least one 5-year period before 2100 exceeding 3.6°C above the 1861-1880 baseline is significant, though not a certainty.
