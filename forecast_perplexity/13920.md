A significant transformation in lunar exploration is underway, with multiple nations actively developing crewed lunar landing programs slated for completion before 2030. Historically, only American astronauts have walked on the Moon, but the coming years are set to reshape this record.

The United States remains at the forefront with NASA’s Artemis program. Artemis III, scheduled for no earlier than 2026, is the first mission targeting a crewed landing since 1972. While its surface crew is most likely to be American, later Artemis missions (IV and V, planned through 2030) are designed to include international astronauts from key partner agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). These partnerships are formalized through the Artemis Accords, which now include over forty countries, significantly increasing the prospects for multinational lunar crews. Though formal crew announcements remain pending, a diverse mix of nationalities on Artemis surface missions before 2030 is anticipated by most analysts and aligns with NASA’s stated commitments.

China has made substantial progress toward its stated goal of landing taikonauts on the Moon by 2030, with some indications suggesting a possible attempt as early as 2027–2029. This would likely make China the second nation to achieve a crewed lunar landing. The Chinese program is advancing rapidly, with new rocket and crew vehicle prototypes in development and dedicated astronaut training underway. Official announcements and recent technical demonstrations support confidence in their timeline.

Other nations—such as Russia, India, and Japan—have expressed intentions or established programs for future crewed lunar exploration. However, neither Russia’s nor India’s plans are likely to materialize before 2030 due to technical, funding, or schedule constraints. India’s government has set a goal for a crewed landing by 2040, placing it outside the window of this forecast. Japan’s primary contributions are currently within the Artemis program and do not include an independent pre-2030 landing.

An additional factor that could influence the total count of nationalities arises from dual or multiple citizenships among astronauts. Depending on crew selection, a single astronaut could add more than one nationality to the total if such cases are recognized under mission rules. This, coupled with the potential for unexpected private missions or accelerated international partnerships, introduces a pathway for the number to exceed currently expected bounds, though such scenarios remain speculative.

The most plausible low-end scenario would involve significant delays across both Artemis and Chinese programs, with only Americans walking on the Moon by 2030 due to technical, financial, or political obstacles. Conversely, the high-end scenario would require accelerated timelines, broad international crew selection, inclusion of dual nationals, and possibly an unforeseen private or government-backed mission from another country, potentially raising the number of represented nationalities to four or more.

In sum, all credible analysis points to an imminent expansion of the list of nationalities to have walked on the Moon by 2030. The United States is certain to add more astronauts, China is highly likely to debut its taikonauts, and at least one Artemis partner nation—likely from among ESA, Canada, or Japan—has a strong chance to join them. Dual or multiple citizenships could nudge the count even higher. While the precise number remains dependent on final crew selections and mission execution, the era of multinational lunar exploration is set to begin before the decade closes.
