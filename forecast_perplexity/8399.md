The global landscape of nuclear-armed states has remained stable at 9 since 2006, demonstrating significant inertia against change. This stability is underpinned by a robust non-proliferation regime that continues to function effectively, deterring most potential nuclear aspirants despite ongoing challenges.

However, several concerning developments could potentially disrupt this equilibrium:

1. North Korea's nuclear program is expanding rapidly, with projections suggesting it could possess over 300 warheads by 2035. This substantial growth could destabilize the region and prompt responses from neighboring countries.

2. Iran's advancing nuclear capabilities, while not yet weaponized, remain a significant concern. A breakdown in diplomatic efforts or a major geopolitical shift could potentially lead Iran to cross the nuclear threshold.

3. Global tensions, particularly among major powers like the US, China, and Russia, are escalating. This increased instability could potentially weaken the non-proliferation regime or alter security calculations for some states.

4. The UK's announced Â£15 billion investment in its nuclear program signals a trend towards modernization and potential expansion among existing nuclear powers. This could influence the strategic thinking of other states.

Despite these factors, the barriers to new states acquiring nuclear weapons remain formidable. The technical, economic, and diplomatic costs of pursuing a nuclear weapons program are substantial, serving as strong deterrents for most countries.

The scenario in which the number of nuclear-armed states increases to 10 or more would likely require a significant breakdown in the current international order or a major regional crisis triggering rapid proliferation. Potential candidates for new nuclear states include Saudi Arabia or Turkey, particularly in response to Iranian nuclearization.

It's important to note that many states with the technical capability to develop nuclear weapons, such as Japan and South Korea, have thus far chosen not to do so. This demonstrates the continued strength of the non-proliferation norm.

While the possibility of additional nuclear-armed states cannot be entirely discounted, the strong historical trend, high barriers to entry, and continued functioning of non-proliferation efforts suggest that dramatic changes are less likely than continuation of the status quo. However, the situation remains dynamic and warrants close monitoring as global tensions evolve.
