# Forecasting Donald Trump's Net Approval Rating on November 2, 2026

As of June 2025, Donald Trump's net approval rating stands at approximately -6.2 percentage points, showing some recent improvement from earlier lows. After an initial steep decline of about 0.2 percentage points per day through mid-April 2025, his approval ratings have stabilized and even slightly improved in May 2025, with some sources indicating a current net negative of around -2 points (48% approval, 50% disapproval).

## Historical Context and Patterns

Presidential approval ratings typically decline as midterm elections approach. During Trump's first term, his net approval hovered between -10 and -15 points for much of his presidency, rarely dipping below -17 to -19 points. This relative stability reflects the highly polarized nature of American politics, where presidential approval ratings have clear floors due to partisan loyalty.

Looking at historical precedent, a president's net approval often declines by approximately 20 points from the 100-day mark to the midterms. With Trump's current approval rating already being the lowest on record for the 100th day of a presidential term, this historical pattern suggests potential further erosion.

## Key Factors That Will Influence Approval Trajectory

### Economic Performance

The impact of Trump's economic policies, particularly his tariff and trade initiatives, will be crucial. If these policies deliver on promised growth, job creation, and manufacturing revival without triggering inflation or trade retaliation, his approval could stabilize or improve. Conversely, if these policies lead to economic downturn, inflation, supply chain disruptions, or retaliatory actions from trading partners, his approval could deteriorate significantly.

### Legislative Achievements or Failures

Major legislative victories or defeats will significantly impact public perception. Bipartisan achievements on issues like infrastructure or immigration could boost approval ratings, while controversial policies around entitlements or healthcare could erode support beyond his base.

### International Affairs

Resolution of international conflicts or effective crisis management could strengthen Trump's position. Conversely, foreign policy missteps or new international crises could put downward pressure on his approval ratings.

### Midterm Election Dynamics

As the 2026 midterms approach, political opposition will intensify, potentially affecting presidential approval. CNN pollster Harry Enten has suggested Republicans have "zero chance" of holding the House if Trump's approval remains at 41% by November 2026, indicating the political stakes involved.

## Potential Scenarios

### Low Approval Scenario

A severe economic downturn triggered by trade policies or a major domestic/international crisis could push Trump's net approval down to historic lows of -20 or worse. A sustained policy backlash or scandal could erode even his base support, testing new lows similar to post-Katrina or post-Iraq ratings seen with previous presidents.

### High Approval Scenario

A strong economic boom where Trump's policies deliver promised growth and job creation could substantially boost his approval. If inflation subsides while wages rise, and if his trade policies successfully revive American manufacturing, his net approval could potentially reach near zero or slightly positive territory, bucking historical midterm trends.

## Expected Range

Given the historical patterns, current trends, and potential scenarios, Trump's net approval on November 2, 2026 will most likely fall between -15 and -7 points. The lower bound reflects continued erosion following historical midterm patterns, while the upper bound assumes his policies gain traction and economic conditions remain favorable.

The extreme lower bound (-20 or below) would require significant economic or political crises, while the extreme upper bound (near zero or positive) would require exceptional economic performance and substantial appeal beyond his base.
