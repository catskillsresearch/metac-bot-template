The time until the number of nuclear reactors in operation in the US is determined is approximately 10.5 years, with the outcome set for December 31, 2035. If the status quo were to remain unchanged, the projected number of reactors by the end of 2025 would be 92, according to the EIA. However, considering the aging fleet and projected retirements, the number of reactors could decrease to around 70-80 by 2035 if no significant new builds or life extensions occur.

Experts and market expectations suggest a moderate decline in the number of reactors, with some new builds and life extensions potentially offsetting retirements. The most likely range is between 68-75 reactors by 2035. However, several unexpected scenarios could alter this trajectory. A significant policy shift away from nuclear energy, combined with accelerated retirements due to economic, regulatory, or safety concerns, could lead to a rapid decline in the number of operational reactors, potentially dropping below 60.

Conversely, a breakthrough in small modular reactor technology, coupled with strong policy support and public acceptance, could lead to a rapid increase in new reactor deployments. This scenario could result in the number of operational reactors exceeding 90 by 2035. These potential developments highlight the uncertainty and variability in the future landscape of nuclear energy in the US.
