The plant-based meat industry is poised for significant growth by 2030, with current projections suggesting the largest single facility could reach a production capacity of 100,000-110,000 metric tons per year. This estimate is based on expert forecasts and industry growth trends, with most predictions falling between 67,000 and 159,000 metric tons annually.

Several factors could influence this outcome. Technological advancements, particularly in plant protein texturization, could dramatically improve production efficiency, taste, and texture of plant-based meats. Such breakthroughs might allow for the creation of mega-facilities with capacities far exceeding current expectations.

Global concerns about climate change and potential meat shortages could drive increased demand for plant-based alternatives, further incentivizing the construction of large-scale production facilities. In an optimistic scenario, a major multinational food company might invest heavily in a flagship plant with cutting-edge equipment and processes, aiming to dominate the market.

However, there are also potential challenges to consider. A global economic recession could severely impact investment in the plant-based meat sector, slowing capacity expansion. Technological hurdles in scaling up production processes might prove more difficult than anticipated, potentially limiting the maximum size of facilities.

Consumer preferences will play a crucial role. While increased climate awareness could boost demand, improvements in competing technologies like lab-grown meat could potentially reduce interest in plant-based alternatives.

Given these factors, it's reasonable to expect that the largest plant-based meat production facility by 2030 could have a capacity ranging from 60,000 metric tons per year in a conservative scenario, to potentially 200,000 metric tons per year in an highly optimistic one. The most likely outcomes fall in the middle of this range, with a median estimate around 107,000-120,000 metric tons annually.
