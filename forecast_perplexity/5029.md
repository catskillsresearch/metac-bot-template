Persistent volatility and deep polarization characterize Scottish attitudes toward independence, with support levels fluctuating between narrow pluralities for both the pro- and anti-independence camps depending on current events, leadership, and campaign framing. The legacy of the 2014 referendum—where voters rejected independence by a 55–45 margin—has set a substantial status quo bias, reinforcing resistance to major constitutional change and making voters especially responsive to arguments about risk, uncertainty, and economic stability.

However, the context has changed markedly in the past decade. The Brexit referendum in 2016, where 62% of Scots voted to remain in the EU, has proven a persistent driver of pro-independence sentiment, deepening the perception that Scottish interests and values often diverge from those prevailing in Westminster. This rift is accentuated in scenarios where right-leaning UK governance is seen as out of step with Scottish preferences. Polling suggests support for independence rises sharply—up to 58% in some cases—if polarizing figures like Nigel Farage become Prime Minister, underlining how reactions to UK political shifts are a crucial variable.

Demographic change fuels long-term momentum for independence. Young Scots overwhelmingly support leaving the UK—67% of those aged 16–34 would vote for independence, compared to less than 40% of those over 55. While some analysts argue that voters grow more risk-averse with age, the generational pattern remains striking and could reshape the electorate in the years ahead as older, more unionist cohorts are replaced by younger, more nationalist ones.

The political and electoral landscape is also increasingly favorable for independence advocates. Pro-independence parties (SNP, Greens, Alba) are projected to maintain or expand their majority in the Scottish Parliament, potentially providing a sustained mandate for demanding a referendum, even as the UK government resists granting one. The rise of Reform UK further complicates the picture for unionists, threatening to fragment their vote and create opportunities for a pro-independence majority at Holyrood elections.

Despite these trends, formidable legal and procedural barriers remain. Westminster retains the power to block a Section 30 order required for a binding referendum, and both Labour and the Conservatives have signaled opposition to another vote in the foreseeable future. Even if a referendum is called, campaign dynamics loom large: economic anxieties, concerns about Scotland’s currency, EU accession, trade, and transition costs are likely to weigh heavily, especially given how such arguments proved decisive in 2014. Historically, undecided and swing voters tend to favor stability during high-stakes constitutional votes, often resulting in late shifts toward the status quo.

Polling in 2025 is both volatile and historically high for independence, with several surveys showing leads or record levels for "Yes"—yet these findings are not uniform, and the outcome remains highly sensitive to external shocks, campaign effectiveness, and late swings in public opinion. While structural factors—generational turnover, Brexit fallout, political divergence, and unionist fragmentation—trend toward a higher likelihood of independence in the medium term, the persistence of campaign risk, legal obstacles, and the gravitational pull of the status quo mean that any future referendum would likely be closely contested, with both outcomes plausible depending on the interplay of these factors.
