# Rationale for US State Psilocybin Decriminalization by January 1, 2027

## Current Landscape

As of mid-2025, the psilocybin decriminalization landscape in the United States shows mixed progress. Colorado has active statewide psilocybin decriminalization and has legalized some supervised use. Oregon initially decriminalized psilocybin in 2020, but much of this measure was repealed in 2024, effectively recriminalizing it at the state level while maintaining supervised use provisions. New Mexico has signed legislation for medical psilocybin access, but the program must be implemented by December 31, 2027, making it uncertain whether it will be operational by January 1, 2027.

If strictly counting states with full decriminalization (not just medical access programs), the baseline is 1-2 states, with Colorado being the clearest example.

## Legislative Momentum

There is significant legislative activity across multiple states:

- Connecticut's House has passed a decriminalization bill that, if enacted, would take effect October 1, 2025. This bill has advanced to the Senate and could become law before 2027.
- Maine has advanced a bill to decriminalize small amounts of psilocybin for adults through committee, potentially becoming law in 2025 or 2026.
- New Hampshire has active legislation with hearings scheduled, aiming for legalization effective January 1, 2026.
- Illinois has House Bill 1143, which would establish a regulated market of psilocybin services similar to those in Oregon and Colorado, and House Bill 1166, which would allocate $300,000 for psilocybin research.
- New Jersey's S2283 would establish a regulated system of psilocybin services similar to Oregon's model.

The broader trend shows at least 24 state legislatures considered bills decriminalizing psilocybin and/or establishing therapeutic programs during the 2023 sessions alone. This widespread legislative interest indicates growing momentum, though the gap between consideration and passage remains significant.

## Factors Accelerating Decriminalization

Several factors could accelerate the pace of psilocybin decriminalization:

- **Medical Recognition**: Psilocybin has twice received "breakthrough therapy" designation from the FDA for research purposes, highlighting its potential therapeutic value.
- **Research Support**: Studies indicating psilocybin's potential benefits in treating treatment-resistant depression and nicotine dependence are bolstering the case for medical access.
- **Public Opinion Shift**: Lifetime psilocybin use among adults has increased from 10% in 2019 to 12.1% in 2023, suggesting growing public acceptance.
- **Law Enforcement Priorities**: Advocates argue that decriminalization would redirect limited law enforcement resources from policing private psychedelic usage to higher priorities like violent crime.

## Potential Barriers

Several factors could slow or reverse progress:

- **Federal Prohibition**: Psilocybin remains illegal under federal law, creating legal uncertainty for state programs.
- **Public Health Concerns**: Increased poison control calls related to psilocybin (reported 201% increase in adults, 317% in teens) could trigger safety concerns.
- **Political Backlash**: Oregon's partial repeal of its decriminalization measure in 2024 demonstrates the potential for policy reversal if public or political sentiment shifts.
- **Implementation Challenges**: Even when laws pass, establishing regulatory frameworks takes time, as seen in Oregon and Colorado's need for clarifying legislation after initial passage.

## Unexpected Scenarios

A lower-than-expected outcome could result from:

- Federal enforcement actions creating a chilling effect on state reforms
- High-profile adverse events generating negative publicity
- Court challenges overturning state decriminalization laws
- Political backlash similar to Oregon's 2024 partial recriminalization

A higher-than-expected outcome could emerge from:

- FDA approval of psilocybin therapy for a major condition
- Federal rescheduling of psilocybin from Schedule I
- Department of Justice guidance deprioritizing prosecution nationwide
- Successful ballot initiatives in multiple states simultaneously

## Projected Outcome

If current trends continue, approximately 3-5 states will likely have decriminalized psilocybin by January 1, 2027. Colorado will maintain its program, and states with advanced legislation like Connecticut, Maine, and New Hampshire have the highest probability of implementing decriminalization before the target date. Other states with active bills (New Jersey, Illinois) could potentially join, but face longer legislative paths and implementation timelines.

In a more conservative scenario, backlash or federal intervention could limit the outcome to just 1-2 states. In a more optimistic scenario with federal policy shifts or accelerated state action, up to 8-10 states could implement decriminalization by the target date.
