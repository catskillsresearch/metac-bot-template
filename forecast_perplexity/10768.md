The historical context and current geopolitical dynamics strongly favor the status quo, with Russia maintaining control over the Kuril Islands. Since the end of World War II, Russia has held control over the islands, and there have been no significant changes in territorial control. The Russian constitution explicitly prohibits ceding any territory, and recent actions, such as military drills and restrictions on foreign navigation, reinforce Russia's resolve to maintain its hold. The entrenched nature of Russian control is further solidified by a strong military presence and administrative infrastructure on the islands.

Diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan remain strained, with no progress towards a peace treaty or territorial negotiations. The economic challenges faced by Russia, including international sanctions, have not directly impacted its control over the Kuril Islands. While Russia's economic situation is deteriorating, there is no direct evidence that this will lead to a loss of control over the islands. The probability of a major geopolitical upheaval or conflict that would result in a change of control is low, given the lack of precedent and the entrenched nature of the dispute.

A scenario that could lead to a change in control would require a significant internal crisis within Russia, such as severe economic collapse or political instability, that weakens its ability to maintain control. Alternatively, a broader regional conflict or international intervention could lead to a shift in control, with Japan or another non-Russian-aligned entity gaining control over the islands. However, these scenarios are highly unlikely within the given timeframe, as there is no indication of a major geopolitical shift that would enable Japan to gain control over the islands. Given these factors, the probability of Russia losing control of the Kuril Islands before 2028 remains very low.
