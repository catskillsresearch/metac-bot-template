Russia’s total fertility rate (TFR) in 2027 is expected to continue its downward trend from recent years, influenced by persistent demographic, economic, and social factors. As of 2024, the TFR stands around 1.40 births per woman, following a decline from 1.50 in 2019 to about 1.41 in 2023. If fertility remains unchanged, this baseline would hold; however, current trends and projections strongly suggest further decline to approximately 1.30–1.35 births per woman by 2027.

This decline is driven primarily by Russia’s shrinking population of women of reproductive age—a demographic contraction resulting from the economic and social turmoil of the 1990s—which is expected to persist until at least 2046. Between 2010 and 2021, the number of women aged 20–29 decreased by roughly 37.5%. In addition, first-time mothers are having children later, with the average age rising beyond 26 years, contributing to lower overall fertility. The number of first and second births has decreased substantially over recent years, indicating delayed or foregone family formation.

Government interventions have sought to counteract the decline through financial incentives like the expanded maternity capital program (providing up to 912,162 rubles for the second child), family mortgage subsidies, uniform child allowances, and regional supports offering up to one million rubles per child. Efforts to reduce abortion rates, including restricting access to private clinics, have also been intensified. Despite these programs, their immediate impact has been limited, as many underlying structural and cultural factors dampen fertility responsiveness in the short term.

Expert assessments, including those from Rosstat and independent demographers such as Alexei Raksha, generally anticipate continued fertility decline until at least 2027, with a possible slow recovery emerging in the late 2020s or early 2030s. Rosstat projects annual births falling to around 1.14 million by 2027, a “200-year low,” which corresponds closely to the forecasted TFR range. Most credible expert consensus clusters the TFR for 2027 between 1.25 and 1.40 births per woman, centering near 1.32.

Unexpected negative factors—such as worsening economic conditions, prolonged war, heightened social instability, stricter international sanctions, increased emigration of young adults, or failure of policy measures—could accelerate the decline, potentially pushing the TFR below 1.20. Conversely, a scenario featuring a rapid economic rebound coupled with dramatically expanded and effectively implemented pronatalist policies (universal childcare, large direct payments, subsidized housing, extended parental leave) and a cultural shift favoring larger families could arrest or modestly reverse the trend, raising the TFR back toward 1.45–1.55 births per woman by 2027.

In summary, the forecast for Russia’s fertility rate in 2027 reflects a continuation of recent demographic declines amid challenging structural factors, with a reasonable expectation of TFR between approximately 1.25 and 1.40 births per woman, barring major socioeconomic disruptions or transformative policy successes.
