## Rationale for Whether 1 Euro Will Fall Below 1 US Dollar Before 2026

The current EUR/USD exchange rate is well above parity, trading in the 1.13–1.15 range as of late May 2025. This level reflects a period of Euro strength over the past year, underpinned by a combination of positive Eurozone economic data, robust investor confidence, and technical factors such as the formation of a golden cross pattern signaling continued upward momentum. The European Central Bank’s relatively hawkish stance, alongside a mild Eurozone recovery and stronger-than-expected German GDP figures, have further contributed to the Euro’s resilience.

Multiple forecasts and market analyses emphasize that the prevailing momentum has mainly been driven by shifts in global capital flows away from the US Dollar, amid declining long-term US bond yields and perceived indecision in US fiscal and monetary policy. The Trump administration’s trade rhetoric and the "One Big Beautiful Bill" have so far injected uncertainty, weakening the Dollar instead of strengthening it, as foreign investors diversify into Euro-denominated assets. A large fiscal stimulus package in Germany and stable to improving macroeconomic indicators have reinforced confidence in the Eurozone, encouraging more capital inflows.

From a technical and historical standpoint, parity events are rare for the EUR/USD pair and typically occur only during extraordinary system-level shocks—such as the 2022 energy crisis and aggressive Fed tightening, both of which briefly pushed the Euro below parity. At present, neither the economic nor the political landscape suggests a repeat of such extreme stress. The current buffer is considerable: reaching parity from current levels would require a drop of more than 13% within a relatively short, seven-month window.

Expert consensus largely anticipates that the EUR/USD will remain above parity for the remainder of 2025, with even the more bearish institutional projections setting their low-end targets between 1.00 and 1.05, and most forecasts exceeding these levels. The status quo bias is strong; absent major shocks, exchange rates for major currencies tend to move gradually and revert to established ranges.

Nevertheless, the principal downside risks are not negligible and warrant monitoring. The most credible catalysts for a reversal include:

- A significant escalation in US-EU trade tensions, especially if President Trump’s threatened 50% tariffs are fully implemented, potentially triggering a sharp slowdown in European exports and economic growth.
- An abrupt economic or financial crisis within the Eurozone—such as a renewed energy shock, banking sector disruption, or elevated political instability—that could reduce investor confidence and spur capital flight.
- Aggressive monetary policy divergence, especially if the US Federal Reserve unexpectedly tightens while the ECB cuts rates.
- A global risk aversion episode or financial shock that prompts investors to seek safety in the US Dollar.

Though such scenarios could push the Euro below parity, they would require rapid and significant deterioration in present conditions. Current data and policy trajectories do not indicate that these risks are imminent, and markets have thus far interpreted trade-related threats as either Dollar-negative or at worst neutral for the Euro.

Given the substantial buffer above parity, the generally positive trajectory for the Euro, the consensus of expert and institutional forecasts projecting continued relative stability, and the absence of clear near-term catalysts for major downside, the probability of the Euro falling below 1 US Dollar before 2026 appears low. However, the possibility of a sharp reversal amid global shocks or unexpected policy shifts cannot be wholly dismissed, making this a tail-risk scenario rather than a base case.
