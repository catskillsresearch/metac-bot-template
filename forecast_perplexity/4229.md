## The Future of Foreign National Population in Mainland China

The question of whether foreign national numbers in China will fall below 2010 levels by 2030 requires examining current trends, policy directions, and potential disruptions to international migration patterns in China.

### Recent Population Trends

According to the Seventh National Population Census, the number of foreign nationals living on the Chinese mainland increased by 42.42% between 2010 and 2020. This translates to approximately 845,800 foreign residents in 2020, up from the 593,832 baseline established in the 2010 census. This substantial growth occurred despite growing concerns about China's decreasing openness during the first years of Xi Jinping's leadership.

Recent immigration data shows continued strong growth in foreign presence in China. In the first quarter of 2025, the National Immigration Administration reported that trips by foreign nationals increased by 33.4% year-on-year to 17.44 million. While these figures primarily represent border crossings rather than permanent residents, they indicate robust recovery and growth in foreign interest in China following the pandemic disruptions.

### Policy Environment and Government Stance

China is actively promoting international travel and engagement through several initiatives:

- The National Immigration Administration has explicitly stated intentions to "expand institutional openness in immigration management" and "introduce more effective entry and exit policies"
- Implementation of visa-free regimes for short-term travel to multiple countries in late 2024 has facilitated increased cross-border movement
- Official rhetoric emphasizes taking "concrete measures to promote China's communication and interaction with the rest of the world"

These policy directions suggest China is seeking to facilitate rather than restrict the movement of foreign nationals into the country, contrary to some narratives about decreasing openness.

### Changing Geographic Distribution

An interesting development is the shifting geographical preferences of foreign residents in China. While major cities traditionally attracted most expatriates (with about a quarter of foreign workers living in Shanghai in 2010), recent trends show foreigners increasingly choosing lower-tier cities and rural areas for their authenticity, peacefulness, and affordability. Yunnan province alone now accounts for 376,000 long-term foreign residents according to recent census data.

This geographic diversification suggests foreign nationals are finding opportunities throughout China rather than concentrating only in traditional expatriate centers, potentially stabilizing the overall foreign population.

### Economic and Demographic Factors

Despite China's overall population decline (decreasing by 2.08 million to 1.41 billion in 2023), several factors continue to attract foreign nationals:

- Foreign nationals, though small in number compared to China's total population, exert economic influence beyond their proportional representation as many hold managerial and professional positions in key industries like information technology and telecommunications
- China's aging demographic profile, with its old-age dependency ratio expected to double to 24% by 2030, may create economic niches that attract foreign workers
- China's continued economic importance globally maintains its attractiveness for foreign professionals, businesses, and students despite some decoupling trends

### Potential Counterforces

Several factors could potentially reduce foreign presence in China:

- Geopolitical tensions between China and Western countries, particularly the United States, could lead to restrictive immigration policies on both sides
- China's push for technological self-sufficiency might reduce reliance on foreign expertise in certain sectors
- Ongoing nationalist policies could create a less welcoming social environment for foreigners
- The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to international mobility between 2020-2023, and residual effects or future health crises could impact migration patterns

## Integrated Assessment

Considering all available evidence, the likelihood of China's foreign national population falling below 2010 levels by 2030 appears relatively low. The 42.42% increase observed from 2010 to 2020 created a substantial buffer above the baseline figure, and recent data from 2025 shows strong recovery and growth in foreign travel to China.

While there are legitimate concerns about China's openness under Xi Jinping and potential economic decoupling from Western nations, the empirical data does not yet support a dramatic reversal of the upward trend in foreign national residents. China's government appears to be actively promoting international engagement through visa and immigration reforms, and the country continues to attract foreign nationals across diverse regions.

For the foreign national population to fall below 2010 levels by 2030, China would need to experience not just a slowing of growth but a significant net outflow of foreign residents sustained over several years. Current policies and trends do not strongly support this scenario, though geopolitical tensions and potential policy shifts remain important wildcards that could alter this trajectory.

Based on current trends, policy direction, and demographic patterns, the foreign national population in China is more likely to remain above 2010 levels through 2030.
