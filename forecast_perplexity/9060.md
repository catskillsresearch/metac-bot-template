The likelihood of a global catastrophe reducing the human population by 95% or more by January 1, 2100, is extremely low. Historically, no event has caused such a drastic reduction, and the resilience and adaptability of human societies make this scenario highly improbable. While catastrophic events, such as highly lethal pandemics, nuclear wars, or unforeseen technological disasters, could lead to significant population declines, a 95% reduction within 25 years following an initial 10% decline is unprecedented. The status quo, where no such decline occurs, remains the most probable outcome given historical trends and current expert assessments. Although emerging technologies and environmental changes pose potential risks, the probability of these leading to a 95% population decline is very low. The resilience of human societies, effective global response measures, and the absence of current trends indicating an imminent global catastrophe of this magnitude further support the improbability of such an outcome.
