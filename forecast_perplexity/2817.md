# U.S. Nuclear Arsenal Projection to 2029

As of May 2024, the United States maintains a nuclear stockpile of approximately 3,708 warheads, already below the 3,800 threshold. This stockpile consists of roughly 1,770 deployed warheads (including 1,370 on ballistic missiles, 300 at strategic bomber bases in the United States, and 100 tactical bombs in Europe) with the remaining 1,938 warheads held in reserve.

## Historical Context and Current Trajectory

The U.S. nuclear arsenal has been on a consistent downward trajectory since its Cold War peak of approximately 31,225 warheads in 1967. This decades-long reduction trend has continued through multiple administrations regardless of political party. Several hundred warheads in the current inventory are specifically scheduled for retirement before 2030, which would further reduce the total count.

## Modernization vs. Expansion

The United States is currently engaged in a comprehensive nuclear modernization program, but this initiative focuses primarily on replacing aging delivery systems rather than increasing warhead numbers:

- The LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM program, with an initial deployment target of May 2029 (though possibly facing delays), represents a modernization of existing capabilities rather than an arsenal expansion
- The Congressional Budget Office has projected costs for nuclear forces through the next decade, including $357 billion for operations and sustainment and $309 billion for modernization
- These budgetary allocations don't indicate plans for stockpile expansion, but rather maintenance and updating of existing systems

## Factors Supporting Continued Reduction or Stability

- **Established policy direction**: The consistent pattern of gradual reductions has institutional momentum
- **Budgetary constraints**: Significant expansion would require substantial new funding authorizations
- **Congressional oversight**: Major changes to nuclear posture face rigorous scrutiny
- **International agreements**: While some treaties have lapsed, the general framework of arms control continues to influence policy
- **Modernization focus**: Current programs prioritize updating delivery systems and ensuring reliability over numerical growth

## Potential Scenarios for Reversal

A scenario that would push the U.S. above 3,800 warheads by 2029 would require:

- A significant and sustained geopolitical crisis, such as direct conflict with Russia or China
- A radical shift in U.S. nuclear policy requiring new presidential directives and congressional authorization
- Substantial budgetary changes specifically allocating funds for warhead production increases
- Years of implementation and production to actually manifest an increased stockpile

Such a reversal would represent an unprecedented change in post-Cold War nuclear policy. It would require not only the political will for such an expansion but also the technical and industrial capacity to execute it within a relatively short timeframe. The absence of any signals indicating such a shift makes this scenario highly unlikely.

## Global Context

While some nuclear powers (notably China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea) are expanding their arsenals, and tensions with Russia have increased following its actions in Ukraine, these developments have not triggered a U.S. policy shift toward arsenal expansion. Instead, they have accelerated investments in delivery system modernization and readiness without increasing warhead numbers.

Given the current stockpile of 3,708 warheads (already below the threshold), planned retirements before 2030, focus on modernization rather than expansion, and absence of any official policy or budgetary indications of a stockpile increase, the most probable outcome is that the United States will maintain 3,800 or fewer nuclear weapons in 2029.
