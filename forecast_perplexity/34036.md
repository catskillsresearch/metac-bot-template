Based on the recent federal actions and legal developments, there is strong evidence pointing toward a potential Department of Justice (DOJ) or Department of Education (DOE) civil compliance investigation into Harvard's diversity-related programs before 2026.

## Current Federal Initiatives and Actions Against DEI Programs

On May 19, 2025, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the Civil Rights Fraud Initiative, which specifically aims to use the False Claims Act (FCA) to investigate and pursue claims against recipients of federal funds that "knowingly violate federal civil rights laws" through "racist preferences, mandates, and activities" including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. This initiative follows two Trump Administration executive orders that connect allegedly unlawful DEI programs to potential treble damages and statutory penalties under the FCA for entities doing business with the federal government.

The initiative's launch comes just days before the May 21, 2025 deadline specified in Executive Order 14173, which required the Attorney General to submit a report containing recommendations for enforcing civil rights laws and identifying "up to nine potential civil compliance investigations" of various entities, including institutions of higher education with endowments exceeding $1 billion. Harvard, with its substantial endowment, clearly falls into this category.

## Harvard as a Primary Target

Harvard is already facing significant federal scrutiny across multiple fronts:

- The DOJ has issued a civil investigative demand (CID) to investigate FCA violations by Harvard University
- The Department of Homeland Security has revoked Harvard's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), preventing the university from enrolling international students
- Harvard has filed a lawsuit challenging the DHS action, indicating escalating tensions with federal authorities
- Federal funding to Harvard, estimated at approximately $2.6 billion, has reportedly been frozen

The DOJ memorandum specifically highlights universities as initial targets, stating that "a university that accepts federal funds could violate the False Claims Act when it encourages antisemitism, refuses to protect Jewish students, allows men to intrude into women's bathrooms, or requires women to compete against men in athletic competitions". This language strongly suggests that universities like Harvard are primary targets for enforcement actions.

## Legal Framework and Strategic Considerations

The current administration is pursuing multiple legal avenues to target DEI programs:

1. **False Claims Act Enforcement**: The primary strategy appears to be using the FCA to target institutions that certify compliance with federal civil rights laws while allegedly engaging in discriminatory practices through DEI programs.

2. **Civil Rights Investigations**: Executive Order 14173 explicitly calls for civil compliance investigations, suggesting that traditional civil rights or Title VI investigations may supplement the FCA approach.

3. **Administrative Actions**: The revocation of Harvard's SEVP certification demonstrates the administration's willingness to use administrative mechanisms to pressure universities.

While the current FCA investigation into Harvard does not fully satisfy the criteria for a civil rights or Title VI compliance investigation specifically targeting diversity programs, it appears to be setting the groundwork for such an investigation.

## Timeline and Probability Considerations

With approximately seven months remaining until January 1, 2026, there is ample time for the DOJ or DOE to announce a formal civil rights investigation into Harvard's diversity programs. The May 19 announcement of the Civil Rights Fraud Initiative and the recent enforcement actions against Harvard suggest an accelerating timeline of federal action.

Several factors increase the likelihood of such an investigation:

- The explicit policy direction from the highest levels of government
- Harvard's high profile as a symbolic target following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision ending affirmative action
- The established pattern of federal actions already targeting Harvard
- The specific mandate in Executive Order 14173 to identify civil compliance investigations

However, some factors might reduce the probability:

- The administration might consider the existing FCA investigation and other actions against Harvard sufficient
- Resources might be directed toward universities that haven't yet faced scrutiny
- Harvard's aggressive legal responses might give federal agencies pause

## Likely Path Forward

Given the administration's demonstrated focus on targeting DEI programs at universities receiving federal funding, with Harvard already under significant scrutiny, the most likely path forward is an escalation from the current FCA investigation to a formal civil rights or Title VI compliance investigation specifically examining Harvard's diversity-related programs.

The Civil Rights Fraud Initiative's explicit focus on universities, coupled with Executive Order 14173's directive to identify potential civil compliance investigations, creates a clear pathway for such an investigation to be announced within the next seven months. The recent actions against Harvard indicate that the university is already a priority target for federal enforcement.

The probability of the DOJ or DOE opening a civil compliance investigation into Harvard's diversity-related programs before 2026 is substantially high, given the current administration's demonstrated commitment to targeting such programs, the specific mechanisms now in place to pursue these investigations, and Harvard's prominence as a symbolic target in the ongoing policy initiative against DEI programs in higher education.
