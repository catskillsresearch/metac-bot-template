The size of the US Supreme Court has remained unchanged at nine justices since 1869, reflecting a long-standing historical stability. This stability is supported by significant political and institutional barriers that make altering the court's size a challenging endeavor. Historically, attempts to change the court's composition have been rare and met with considerable political contention. The current political climate, as of 2025, does not exhibit any substantial momentum towards changing the court's size. Public opinion and institutional norms continue to resist such changes, and there is a lack of consensus among lawmakers, with other legislative priorities often taking precedence.

For a change in the court's size to occur, a significant political shift would be necessary. This could involve one party gaining a supermajority in both Congress and the presidency, coupled with a strong public mandate to reform the judiciary. Such a shift might be driven by a perceived need to rebalance the court ideologically or to address perceived injustices in its decisions. Additionally, a major political or constitutional crisis could galvanize public support for court expansion, providing the necessary political momentum for change.

Despite these possibilities, the status quo remains a powerful force. The US political system is designed to make such changes difficult without broad consensus, and the entrenched nature of the current system suggests that the probability of change remains low. While the long time horizon until 2050 introduces some uncertainty, as political and social conditions could change dramatically, any scenarios leading to a change in the court's size are speculative and would require extraordinary developments. Therefore, the likelihood of the US Supreme Court changing its membership size before 2050 is relatively low.
