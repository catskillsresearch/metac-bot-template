# Comprehensive Rationale on Israel's Potential for Early Intelligence-Based Embryo Selection

Israel holds a unique position in the global landscape of reproductive technology that makes it a significant contender to be among the first ten countries to engage in widespread embryo selection for intelligence. However, several key factors must be considered when assessing this possibility.

## Current Regulatory Environment

As of mid-2025, Israel maintains strict regulations regarding embryo selection, with a clear distinction between medical and non-medical applications. The Embryo Carrying Agreements Law and Health Ministry regulations explicitly prohibit polygenic embryo selection for intelligence (PGT-P). The Ministry controls which genetic tests are permitted, focusing exclusively on high-penetrance, severe diseases with clear medical significance. Non-medical selection requires exceptional approval from special boards and is not covered by national health insurance.

## Israel's Unique Reproductive Technology Landscape

Despite regulatory restrictions on intelligence selection, Israel possesses several characteristics that could position it for rapid adoption if policies change:

**World-Leading IVF Infrastructure**: Israel has the highest per-capita IVF usage globally, with extensive state subsidization of fertility treatments. The national healthcare system provides full coverage for multiple IVF cycles (up to two children per family).

**Advanced Genetic Testing Framework**: Israel has already demonstrated widespread acceptance of genetic testing through successful disease prevention programs. The virtual elimination of genetic diseases like Tay-Sachs shows cultural comfort with genetic interventions.

**Technological Innovation**: Israeli companies are at the forefront of developing AI-powered embryo selection systems, though currently focused on improving pregnancy rates rather than selecting for intelligence. These technologies, like Fairtility's AI tool which received European approval, demonstrate Israel's capabilities in applying advanced technology to reproductive medicine.

**Bioethical Permissiveness**: Israel has a relatively permissive bioethical stance toward genetic interventions compared to many other countries. Judaism generally considers preimplantation embryos differently than implanted embryos, creating less religious resistance to embryo manipulation.

## Barriers to Widespread Adoption

The primary obstacle to Israel becoming an early adopter of intelligence-based embryo selection is regulatory rather than technological:

**Strict Legal Framework**: The Health Ministry's controls are strong, categorically prohibiting non-medical selection except in rare circumstances. As of 2025, there are no signals of regulatory shifts, pilot programs, or public policy debates indicating imminent liberalization.

**Ethical Considerations**: The transition from disease prevention to enhancement represents a significant policy leap that faces ethical scrutiny. The Health Ministry has yet to even issue a statement on polygenic screening of embryos, suggesting caution or political sensitivity.

**Global Normative Context**: No country has yet approached the 10% threshold for intelligence-selected newborns. For Israel to be among the first ten, there would need to be both global movement in this direction and domestic policy change.

## Scenarios for Change

For Israel to become one of the first ten countries with >10% of newborns selected for intelligence, certain developments would be necessary:

**Regulatory Liberalization**: The most decisive variable is regulation. The Ministry of Health would need to either legalize or create exceptions for polygenic selection based on intelligence.

**Technological Advancement**: Polygenic scores for intelligence would need to demonstrate reliable and significant expected IQ gains (at least 3 points) to drive demand and justify policy changes.

**Public Acceptance**: Cultural norms would need to evolve from accepting disease prevention to embracing enhancement, though Israel's existing comfort with genetic interventions suggests this could occur relatively quickly compared to other countries.

**Economic Integration**: The procedure would likely need to become accessible either through private clinics initially and potentially later through public funding.

## Competitive Global Context

Israel's chances must be considered relative to other countries that might move more quickly:

**Less Regulated Markets**: Countries with less restrictive policies or larger private fertility sectors (e.g., the U.S., China, Singapore, UAE) could potentially surpass the 10% threshold before Israel if they liberalize first.

**Commercial Pressure**: The winner in this space may be determined not just by technological readiness but by which country's policymakers or commercial sector first normalizes enhancement-based selection.

## Conclusion

Israel possesses exceptional foundational elements that could position it to be among the first ten countries to exceed the 10% threshold for intelligence-based embryo selection â€“ outstanding IVF infrastructure, technological innovation, bioethical permissiveness, and cultural acceptance of genetic interventions. However, current regulatory prohibition creates a significant barrier that would require deliberate policy change to overcome.

If regulations were to change within the coming decades, Israel's strong underlying infrastructure and cultural factors could lead to rapid adoption, particularly given its history of embracing reproductive technologies. Without such change, Israel is unlikely to be among the first countries to cross this threshold, regardless of its technological capabilities.

The probability of Israel being among the first ten countries to select >10% of newborns for intelligence depends primarily on whether and when regulatory change occurs, balanced against how quickly other countries might move in this direction.
