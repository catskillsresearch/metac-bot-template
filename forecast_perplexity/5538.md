The mandate to sell only zero-emission electric cars and passenger trucks in California by 2035 is set against a backdrop of significant progress and challenges. California has historically been a leader in setting stringent emissions standards and has made considerable strides towards the 2035 ZEV mandate, with increasing sales of zero-emission vehicles and supportive regulations. This proactive approach suggests a favorable trajectory towards achieving the mandate.

However, the recent U.S. Senate vote to block California's electric car mandate introduces a layer of uncertainty. If upheld, this decision could prevent California from enforcing its stricter emissions standards, potentially leading to a legal battle. The outcome of such a legal challenge is uncertain, and a loss could hinder the state's ability to implement the mandate as planned.

On the other hand, if California successfully challenges the Senate's decision in court, it would maintain its authority to set stricter emissions standards. This, combined with ongoing advancements in zero-emission vehicle technology, infrastructure development, and consumer adoption, would bolster the likelihood of the mandate's full implementation by 2035.

Despite the federal challenge, California's historical resilience in maintaining its environmental standards and the global shift towards electric vehicles provide a strong foundation for overcoming these obstacles. The legal and political landscape may evolve, but California's commitment to its environmental goals and its track record of defending its regulatory authority suggest a reasonable probability of achieving the mandate.
