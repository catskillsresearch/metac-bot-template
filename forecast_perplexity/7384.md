The likelihood of mainstream news media reporting that alien technology has visited our solar system by 2030 is predominantly influenced by the current status quo, which leans towards a "No" outcome. Historically, claims of extraterrestrial technology have not been substantiated with conclusive evidence, and the evidentiary threshold for such a claim is exceptionally high. Despite increased transparency and interest in Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), the transition from speculation to confirmed alien technology is a significant leap. 

Ongoing investigations and interest in UAPs have yet to yield conclusive evidence that would satisfy the rigorous standards required for mainstream media to report it as fact. Government reports and scientific studies continue to explore these phenomena but often attribute them to natural or human-made causes, maintaining a speculative status without definitive proof. The historical pattern of skepticism and the need for extraordinary evidence further complicate the potential for a "Yes" outcome.

For a "Yes" scenario to occur, a significant breakthrough would be necessary. This would involve the discovery of compelling evidence of non-human extraterrestrial technology, corroborated by multiple credible sources, including government reports and scientific studies. Such evidence would need to be verified and widely accepted by the scientific community, prompting credible media outlets to report it. However, given the historical context, the nature of scientific and governmental processes, and the challenges of verification and institutional resistance, the probability of such a discovery being reported by 2030 remains low.
