The long-standing tensions between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus have persisted for decades without escalating into large-scale armed conflict, suggesting a strong inertia against major hostilities. This status quo is supported by several key factors:

1. NATO membership of Greece and Turkey provides a framework for conflict prevention and management.
2. Economic interdependence and EU ties (for Greece and Cyprus) create significant disincentives for war.
3. International diplomatic engagement and mediation help manage crises when they arise.
4. The high cost and risks associated with modern warfare make full-scale conflict less appealing to all parties involved.

However, persistent tensions and unresolved disputes do create a non-zero risk of escalation:

1. Ongoing disputes over maritime boundaries and resources in the Aegean Sea and Eastern Mediterranean remain flashpoints.
2. The unresolved Cyprus situation continues to be a source of friction.
3. Occasional military incidents, such as airspace violations, could potentially spiral into larger confrontations.
4. Domestic political factors in both countries can sometimes incentivize aggressive posturing or hardline stances.
5. Military modernization efforts, particularly by Turkey, could alter regional power dynamics.

The threshold of 1,000 deaths in a year is quite high and would likely require a sustained, high-intensity engagement. Most incidents or crises would probably be contained before reaching this level of intensity. The absence of any immediate escalatory triggers further supports maintaining significant weight on the status quo outcome.

The long timeframe until 2035 introduces additional uncertainty. While this allows more time for tensions to potentially boil over, it also provides opportunities for diplomatic solutions and further entrenchment of conflict prevention measures.

Weighing these factors, the probability of an armed conflict causing 1,000+ deaths in a year before 2035 remains low, but not negligible. The long-standing pattern of crisis management, the high stakes of armed conflict for all parties involved, and the multiple layers of international engagement suggest that while the risk exists, a major armed conflict is unlikely to occur.
