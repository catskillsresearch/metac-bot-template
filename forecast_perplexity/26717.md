Rationale:

The development of widely available radical life extension treatments within five years of AGI's arrival presents a significant challenge, given the current state of longevity research and the complexities involved in aging biology. While recent advancements in the field are promising, we are still far from treatments that could enable more than 20% of 70-year-olds to live an additional 50 years.

The potential impact of AGI on longevity research could be transformative. AGI could dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and technological development in this field, potentially solving key challenges in understanding and reversing the aging process. The involvement of well-funded organizations and high-profile individuals in longevity research suggests significant resources will be directed towards this goal once AGI arrives.

However, several significant hurdles must be overcome:

1. Biological complexity: Aging involves multiple complex processes that may be difficult to fully address even with AGI assistance.

2. Time constraint: The 5-year window after AGI is relatively short for developing, testing, approving, and widely distributing radical life extension treatments.

3. Regulatory hurdles: Even with breakthrough treatments, regulatory approval processes could slow widespread availability. However, if the benefits are clear, these processes might be streamlined.

4. Distribution and accessibility: Ensuring global access to these treatments within 5 years would be logistically challenging.

5. Societal adoption: Achieving over 20% adoption among 70-year-olds within this timeframe is ambitious and would require rapid shifts in societal norms.

The involvement of major tech companies and significant funding in longevity research increases the chances of rapid progress. If AGI proves exceptionally capable in biomedical applications, it could potentially overcome many of these hurdles more quickly than we might expect based on current trajectories.

Given these factors, while the probability of success remains below 50% due to the significant challenges and the short timeframe, there is a non-trivial chance of achieving this outcome. The transformative potential of AGI leaves room for the possibility of a breakthrough that could dramatically alter the landscape of longevity science and treatment availability.
