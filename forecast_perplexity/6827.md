The time frame for determining whether a supernova will be observed in the Milky Way Galaxy is approximately 24 years and 7 months, with the question resolving on January 1, 2050. Historically, the last observed supernova in the Milky Way was in 1604, suggesting a "No" outcome if the status quo persists. However, this historical gap is likely due to past limitations in detection capabilities rather than an absence of supernova events.

The estimated rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is between 1-10 per century, with recent estimates suggesting around 4.6 per century. This indicates that supernovae are relatively frequent events, but their detection has been hindered by factors such as galactic dust obscuration and the spatial distribution of supernova progenitors. These factors can make supernovae difficult to observe with traditional optical telescopes.

Advancements in modern astronomy, particularly in multi-messenger techniques, have significantly increased the likelihood of detecting supernovae. Instruments such as neutrino detectors, gravitational wave observatories, and infrared telescopes can penetrate galactic dust and detect supernovae that are not visible to the naked eye. These technologies provide early warnings and enhance our ability to observe supernova events, even if they occur in less observable regions of the galaxy.

Given these advancements and the estimated rate of supernovae, the probability of observing a supernova in the Milky Way by 2050 is high. The historical lack of observed supernovae is more likely an anomaly due to past technological limitations rather than a true absence of events. Therefore, the combination of expected supernova frequency and improved detection capabilities suggests a strong likelihood of detection within the given timeframe.
