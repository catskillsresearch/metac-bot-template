The timeline for determining whether nuclear fusion will provide more than 10% of the world’s energy within five years after the arrival of AGI is uncertain, as it hinges on when AGI is achieved. If AGI emerges in the next 5-10 years, the outcome could be known by 2035-2040. However, the status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. As of 2024, nuclear fusion has not yet delivered net electricity to the grid, and there are significant engineering, regulatory, and infrastructure challenges that need to be overcome. The transition from experimental success to commercial viability and large-scale deployment is expected to take decades, even with accelerated progress.

A No outcome scenario is characterized by continued technical and logistical challenges in scaling fusion technology. Despite potential AGI-driven advancements, the physical constraints of building and deploying fusion reactors, regulatory hurdles, and the need for substantial infrastructure upgrades could prevent fusion from reaching a significant share of the global energy mix. Additionally, competition from other energy sources, such as solar, wind, and advanced nuclear fission, may further limit fusion's market share.

Conversely, a Yes outcome would require rapid breakthroughs in fusion technology facilitated by AGI. This would involve AGI accelerating research and development, optimizing reactor designs, and streamlining regulatory processes. Such advancements could lead to the successful deployment of commercial fusion power plants, supported by unprecedented global collaboration, investment, and infrastructure development. Geopolitical and economic factors would need to align to prioritize fusion as a key energy source, with AGI optimizing every aspect of the process to achieve rapid deployment and integration into the global energy grid.

Overall, while AGI has the potential to accelerate progress, the historical and ongoing challenges in developing and deploying fusion technology at scale, combined with the unprecedented rate of infrastructure buildout required, make it unlikely that fusion will provide more than 10% of the world’s energy within five years after AGI. Historical precedent shows that new energy sources typically take decades to achieve such a substantial share of the global energy mix.
