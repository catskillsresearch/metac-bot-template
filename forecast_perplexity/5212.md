The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) presents significant challenges for legacy automakers, including high capital requirements, increased competition from new entrants, and the need to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics. Historically, large automakers have demonstrated resilience through restructuring, government bailouts, and mergers or acquisitions, which have helped them avoid bankruptcy. The automotive industry is crucial to many national economies, providing strong incentives for governments to intervene and support these companies in times of financial distress.

Legacy automakers could successfully navigate the transition to EVs by leveraging their existing resources, forming strategic partnerships, and securing necessary investments. They may also benefit from a gradual increase in consumer demand for EVs, allowing them to maintain profitability and avoid financial distress. Cost-cutting measures and maintaining a balanced portfolio of internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV models could further bolster their financial health.

However, the probability of financial distress is not negligible. Scenarios that could lead to bankruptcy include underperforming EV investments, rapid declines in ICE vehicle sales, increased competition, and severe economic downturns. These factors could exacerbate financial challenges, potentially leading to situations where automakers are unable to meet their financial obligations.

Despite these risks, the likelihood of outright bankruptcy remains moderated by potential government interventions and the slow pace of change in large industries. The time frame until 2030 allows for potential adjustments and strategic pivots by these companies, making the status quo outcome, where no major legacy automaker declares bankruptcy, more likely. Nonetheless, the unprecedented scale of the current technological and regulatory shifts means that the possibility of a bankruptcy event cannot be entirely dismissed.
