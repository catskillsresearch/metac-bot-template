## Rationale for the Likelihood of Congress Passing a Bill Implementing Trump’s Tariff Policies in 2025

As of late May 2025, President Trump’s sweeping tariffs—most notably a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and higher reciprocal tariffs for countries with large trade deficits—have been implemented unilaterally via executive authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This reliance on executive action, rather than legislation, has defined the current landscape of tariff policy in the United States. The executive branch's direct approach reduces the necessity and urgency for congressional codification, especially given longstanding presidential preference for flexibility in trade matters.

### Congressional Dynamics and Legislative Focus

Congress has shown little inclination to codify these broad tariffs into law. No bill imposing a 10% or greater across-the-board tariff on nearly all imports has been introduced, advanced, or prioritized in either chamber. Instead, legislative efforts are primarily directed toward restraining the president’s tariff authority. Notable bipartisan initiatives, such as the "Trade Review Act of 2025," seek to require congressional approval for future tariffs, a clear sign of discomfort with sweeping, unsupervised executive action. Both Republican and Democratic members have raised concerns, with some Republicans openly questioning the wisdom and economic impact of the tariffs, and others quietly sharing this skepticism.

The Senate recently split 49-49 on a resolution rebuking Trump’s national emergency declaration for tariffs, requiring a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President to protect the administration's stance. This close and symbolic vote highlights the divided nature of the Republican caucus and the existence of bipartisan unease. Nevertheless, the practical momentum in Congress is behind tax legislation and targeted sanctions, not sweeping tariff statutes.

### Economic and Political Obstacles

Economic analyses underscore significant drawbacks to enacting Trump’s tariff regime via legislation. The Tax Foundation estimates the 2025 tariffs amount to an average tax increase of nearly $1,200 per US household and would reduce long-run US GDP by 0.7% to 0.9%. Such projections have amplified unease among lawmakers regarding the tariffs’ effect on consumers, the broader economy, and Republican economic priorities—particularly given efforts to extend tax cuts, which are seen as more politically advantageous and economically stimulative.

Market instability and declining consumer sentiment have accompanied the tariff announcements, with reports of negative shocks to the stock market and heightened uncertainty among businesses and investors. These effects further reduce legislative appetite for broadening or formalizing the tariffs, especially as lawsuits from several states challenge the administration’s unilateral actions.

### Legal Status and Executive-Legislative Interaction

Courts have thus far upheld the president's broad authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA, though litigation continues. This judicial validation of executive power diminishes the impetus for congressional action, as the administration can continue implementing its tariff agenda without legislative backing. Should courts eventually curtail that authority, Congress might face renewed pressure to act, but such a scenario would likely arise only after appeal processes are exhausted and would not align with the timeline or legislative calendar for 2025.

### Institutional and Historical Context

The U.S. Congress has rarely, if ever, enacted universal tariff hikes by statute in the modern era, typically leaving such measures to executive discretion or engaging in targeted trade action. Current congressional activity reflects this precedent, with any new tariff legislation focusing narrowly—for instance, proposing massive tariffs on countries supporting Russian energy—rather than embracing an all-encompassing approach.

### Outlook

Given persistent economic, political, and procedural headwinds, alongside clear evidence that Congress is more interested in oversight than endorsement of Trump’s tariff strategy, the probability of a bill passing to implement across-the-board tariffs in 2025 remains exceedingly low. The administration’s effective use of executive power, legal validation by the courts, congressional inertia toward comprehensive tariff legislation, and prevailing legislative priorities all reinforce the status quo: Trump’s tariffs continue by executive action, not by congressional mandate. 

A dramatic reversal would require an extraordinary catalyst, such as a severe economic shock or unprecedented legislative realignment, neither of which appears imminent given current conditions.
