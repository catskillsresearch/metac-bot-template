China’s total fertility rate in 2031 is expected to remain very low, likely clustering around 1.1 births per woman, with most estimates falling between about 0.8 and 1.4. Under current conditions, absent significant changes, the continuing trends indicate little deviation from this status quo. Several factors support this outlook. Many analyses point to the combined impact of persistent economic pressures—including rising living costs, housing and education expenses, and a shrinking population of women in childbearing age—as well as deeply rooted cultural norms that tend to favor smaller family sizes. In scenarios where these challenges intensify, the fertility rate could edge closer to 0.8 births per woman. Conversely, if there is an effective and well-targeted government response—characterized by robust pro-natalist policies, generous childcare subsidies, and broader social initiatives that successfully shift cultural attitudes—the TFR could be nudged upward toward approximately 1.4 births per woman. Overall, without transformative policy or unforeseen socioeconomic shifts, China’s fertility dynamics appear poised to maintain the current low level.
