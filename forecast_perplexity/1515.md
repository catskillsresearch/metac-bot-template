## Rationale for the Likelihood of Functionally Important Human Neurogenesis Throughout Life Before 2028

The debate surrounding the presence and functional relevance of adult neurogenesis in humans remains unresolved, with the field characterized by persistent uncertainty and division as of mid-2025. Since the late 1990s, research has consistently demonstrated robust neurogenesis in non-human mammals, particularly in the hippocampus, but translating these findings to humans has proven highly contentious. The issue is compounded by directly conflicting high-quality studies; for instance, Sorrells et al. (2018) reported that neurogenesis in the human hippocampus declines to undetectable levels during childhood and is absent in adults, while Boldrini et al. (2018) found evidence supporting ongoing adult neurogenesis. No definitive methodological or empirical breakthrough has since resolved this contradiction.

Technical and conceptual barriers remain formidable. Detection of neurogenesis in adult human brain tissue is highly sensitive to factors such as tissue preservation, cell marker selection, and postmortem processing. The rarity of neural progenitor cells further complicates efforts to reliably identify new neurons. Reliable, non-invasive methods for measuring neurogenesis in living humans have not been established, so most evidence relies on indirect or postmortem studies, each with their own limitations and susceptibility to artifact.

The bar for demonstrating functional importance is especially high. Even if evidence for some adult neurogenesis emerges, proving these new neurons are sufficiently abundant, integrate into existing circuits, and meaningfully impact cognition, memory, or other brain functions is a distinct and much more difficult criterion to meet. No study to date has provided uncontested, top-tier evidence of functionally important neurogenesis persisting across the full human lifespan.

Historical patterns in neuroscience show that shifts in consensus regarding issues involving complex measurement and interpretation—like adult neurogenesis—are slow, especially in the absence of clear methodological advances. Reviews and news coverage up to 2025 continue to describe the field as “hotly debated,” with leading experts acknowledging the absence of a consensus and highlighting ongoing technical challenges. Most recent human brain studies focus on indirect measures such as functional connectivity or plasticity, rather than direct demonstration of neurogenesis and its functional consequences.

While technical advances in molecular biology, imaging, and single-cell analysis may ultimately resolve the issue, as of mid-2025, there is no indication that a transformative breakthrough is imminent or that consensus is shifting decisively toward either side. Some recent studies in animal models and reports of brain plasticity trends provide optimism for future discovery, but have not yet produced the level of definitive, reproducible evidence in humans required to change the overall assessment.

Given these factors, the prevailing rational basis is that the field will likely remain unresolved or trend toward skepticism about persistent, functionally important adult neurogenesis in humans before 2028, unless a landmark methodological breakthrough occurs. Only such a breakthrough—resulting in robust, widely-accepted evidence published in a top-tier journal, without compelling contradiction—would be sufficient to shift the scientific consensus. As of now, the best-supported position is a cautious default to ongoing ambiguity, with a slight possibility for a breakthrough but no strong evidence that such a resolution is imminent.
