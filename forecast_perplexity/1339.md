The time frame for determining the average number of habitable planets per star is approximately 93 years, with an expected resolution by September 7, 2118. Current credible estimates from 2018 suggest that the number of habitable planets per star ranges between 0.1 and 0.4. However, if current trends in exoplanet discovery and our understanding of habitability continue, this number could increase, potentially reaching between 0.5 and 1.0. This potential increase is supported by the inclusion of moons and broader definitions of habitability, as well as advancements in detection technologies and missions like TESS and the James Webb Space Telescope.

Experts anticipate that as more exoplanets are discovered and our definitions of habitability expand, the estimate for the number of habitable planets per star will likely increase. The growing market for space exploration and research further supports this trend, as it encourages continued investment and discovery in this field.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these estimates. A scenario where new research narrows the criteria for habitability, perhaps due to unforeseen environmental or chemical constraints, could result in a lower estimate, potentially below 0.1. Conversely, a breakthrough in detecting life-supporting conditions on a wide range of celestial bodies, including moons and non-Earth-like environments, could lead to a higher estimate, potentially exceeding 1.0. Discoveries of new classes of habitable environments, such as subsurface oceans or non-water-based life forms, could also dramatically increase the estimate.
