## Rationale for the Probability That China Would Attack the United States If It Invades Taiwan and the US Intervenes Before 2035

If China launches an invasion of Taiwan before 2035 and the United States intervenes militarily, the prospect of China attacking US territory is determined by a complex interplay of strategic calculations, military doctrine, historical precedent, and escalation dynamics.

**Strategic Context and Military Posture**

Chinese military preparations and modernization over the past decade have been geared principally towards coercing Taiwan and deterring or complicating US intervention through anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in the broader Western Pacific region. This includes significant investments in missile forces, naval assets, and advanced air defense, primarily aimed at controlling the immediate theater of operations around Taiwan and making US intervention as costly as possible. Critical timelines—such as the so-called "Davidson window" around 2027—reflect Beijing’s ambitions to reach a credible level of military readiness for potential operations against Taiwan.

Despite these military preparations, Chinese doctrine and public statements repeatedly frame potential responses to US intervention as “firm actions” to safeguard “sovereignty and security interests” without specifying intentions to attack US homeland territory. There is no evidence in open-source military doctrine, exercises, or authoritative statements that China intends or is preparing for direct attacks against the continental United States in a Taiwan scenario. The focus remains on defeating or deterring US forces in-theater—targeting US bases, naval assets, and regional allies rather than the US homeland.

**Escalation Risks and Deterrence Considerations**

Any decision to attack US territory would represent a radical departure from historical precedent among nuclear-armed states. Since World War II—including throughout the Cold War—no nuclear power has deliberately attacked the homeland of another nuclear power due to the extreme risk of nuclear retaliation and catastrophic escalation. China’s leadership, particularly under Xi Jinping, has displayed a consistent pattern of risk aversion regarding any action that could threaten regime survival or result in unpredictable existential consequences.

That said, the potential for escalation cannot be dismissed outright. If US military intervention were to inflict severe losses on Chinese forces, threaten the success of the Taiwan operation, or pose a perceived existential threat to CCP rule, Chinese leadership might consider expanding the conflict as a form of extreme coercion. In such scenarios, limited strikes—particularly on US military bases in Guam, Hawaii, or other overseas territories—could be viewed as a way to signal resolve or attempt to force US withdrawal, especially if Beijing believes nuclear thresholds would not be crossed by limited, carefully calibrated actions.

**Constraints on Direct Attacks**

There remain potent deterrents against such escalation:

- **Nuclear Escalation:** Any attack on US territory would risk nuclear retaliation, a move that would imperil both regime survival and potentially all of China.
- **Economic Interdependence:** China’s deep integration with global markets, especially with the United States, means direct attacks would trigger devastating global economic consequences, undermining both wartime aims and domestic legitimacy.
- **Military Limitations:** Despite improvements, China’s conventional power projection capability against the US mainland is still limited.
- **Historical Patterns:** As seen in previous great power rivalries, direct attacks are typically avoided in favor of regional military action, proxy warfare, and other indirect means.

**Possible Triggers for Escalation**

Nevertheless, several extreme scenarios could result in Chinese attacks on US homeland or territories:

- The US conducts extensive, damaging strikes on the Chinese mainland, especially targeting critical facilities or regime leadership.
- Chinese leadership perceives that the regime’s survival is in imminent jeopardy as a result of US intervention.
- Escalation spirals out of control due to miscalculation, communication failures, or unanticipated battlefield developments.
- Internal political dynamics or desperation might drive Chinese leaders to authorize previously unthinkable actions.

Even in these scenarios, most expert assessments indicate that the likeliest targets for any expansion of hostilities would be US military bases in the Western Pacific—such as Guam or Hawaii—rather than the continental United States, and most Chinese operations would continue to focus on defeating US intervention forces in the Taiwan theater.

**Conclusion**

China’s guiding logic in a Taiwan conflict involving US intervention would be to achieve its objectives at minimal risk of catastrophic escalation. While a direct attack on US territory cannot be ruled out entirely—especially in scenarios involving miscalculation or existential threats—it remains highly improbable given the overwhelming deterrents and the absence of doctrinal precedent or concrete preparations for such actions. The inertia of history, risk aversion among nuclear powers, and the strategic calculus of the CCP combine to make such an attack an outlier scenario, albeit one that cannot be dismissed as entirely impossible.
