# Comprehensive Assessment: H5 Avian Influenza Public Health Emergency Declaration Prospects

The potential for an HHS public health emergency declaration for H5 avian influenza before January 1, 2026 requires careful analysis of current trends, historical precedents, and key risk factors. With just over 7 months remaining until the deadline, the situation presents concerning developments that must be weighed against the established threshold for federal emergency action.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of May 2025, the H5N1 avian influenza situation shows a gradual but concerning evolution:

- Human cases have increased to 70 in the US (up from 58 in December 2024), representing a 20.7% increase over five months
- The first US death occurred in January 2025, marking a significant escalation in severity
- Three cases now have no identified source of infection (up from two in December), suggesting potential undetected transmission
- The virus has been detected in wastewater systems, indicating wider circulation
- Despite these developments, the CDC and WHO continue to assess the risk to the general public as "low"

Most infections have occurred in farm workers with direct exposure to infected cattle or poultry, primarily presenting with conjunctivitis and mild flu-like symptoms. The absence of confirmed sustained human-to-human transmission remains a key factor in the current risk assessment.

## Declaration Criteria and Historical Context

Under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, the HHS Secretary can declare a public health emergency if they determine that a disease presents a public health emergency or that a significant outbreak of infectious disease otherwise exists. Such declarations typically last 90 days but can be extended.

Previous infectious disease PHE declarations provide important context:
- H1N1 (2009): Declared after evidence of rapid global spread and sustained human-to-human transmission
- Zika (2016): Declared after evidence of birth defects and local transmission in the US
- COVID-19 (2020): Declared early with evidence of human-to-human spread
- Mpox (2022): Declared after cases reached several thousand nationwide

The current H5N1 situation has not yet demonstrated the key features that triggered these previous declarations, particularly sustained human-to-human transmission or explosive case growth.

## Factors Supporting a PHE Declaration

Several developments increase the likelihood of an HHS declaration before January 2026:

1. **Rising case numbers**: The 20.7% increase over five months shows a continuing upward trend
2. **First US death**: The January 2025 fatality demonstrates potential severity
3. **Unexplained cases**: Three cases with no identified exposure source raise concerns about undetected transmission patterns
4. **Environmental detection**: Virus presence in wastewater suggests wider circulation than confirmed cases indicate
5. **Preparedness investments**: $590 million granted to Moderna for H5N1 vaccine development indicates serious government concern
6. **Surveillance challenges**: USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has lost 1,377 employees, including 400 veterinarians, potentially hampering response capabilities
7. **Expert warnings**: Scientists have characterized the situation as "living next to a volcano" with serious pandemic potential

## Factors Against a PHE Declaration

Several considerations weigh against an imminent declaration:

1. **Current risk assessment**: Both CDC and WHO maintain that "the avian flu risk to the general public remains low"
2. **Limited human-to-human spread**: No confirmed sustained transmission between humans
3. **Case presentation**: Most human infections present with mild symptoms
4. **Relatively low case numbers**: 70 confirmed cases remains below the threshold that triggered some previous declarations
5. **Existing measures**: Current surveillance and preparedness activities may be deemed sufficient without a formal declaration
6. **Post-COVID considerations**: There may be institutional reluctance to declare another PHE following the extensive COVID-19 emergency period

## Key Inflection Points to Watch

The most likely triggers for a PHE declaration would include:

1. **Evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission**: This represents the clearest threshold for escalated response
2. **Significant increase in unexplained cases**: Further cases without animal exposure would suggest undetected community spread
3. **Genetic changes**: Viral mutations enhancing transmissibility or virulence would prompt greater concern
4. **Increased severity**: Additional deaths or hospitalizations would elevate the threat assessment
5. **Geographic expansion**: Spread beyond agricultural settings into urban or community environments
6. **Official risk assessment changes**: If CDC or WHO revises risk levels upward from "low"

## Future Scenarios

The status quo continues to be no declaration, with most cases linked to animal exposure and mild symptoms. However, the 7-month timeframe provides ample opportunity for the situation to evolve. 

A "no declaration" scenario would likely involve continued sporadic cases primarily among those with animal exposure, maintenance of the "low risk" assessment, and reliance on existing public health measures without the need for emergency powers.

A "declaration" scenario would likely be triggered by accelerating case numbers, evidence of human-to-human transmission, increased severity or deaths, expansion to new populations or regions, or a significant revision of risk assessments by public health authorities.

Given the virus's demonstrated ability to infect mammals, the appearance of unexplained cases, and the detection in wastewater, there are legitimate concerns about its potential for adaptation and wider spread. The situation bears careful monitoring, as relatively small changes in viral characteristics could rapidly alter the risk assessment and necessitate emergency measures.
