Australia is projected to avoid a technical recession—defined as two consecutive quarters of negative aggregate GDP—before 2026, barring a significant external or domestic shock. The consensus among major institutional forecasters, including the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), IMF, and KPMG, is for slow but positive GDP growth in 2025, with most forecasts in the 1.6%–2.0% range for the year. The government and central bank anticipate economic momentum to gradually improve, aided by an expected cycle of interest rate cuts beginning in early 2025 and inflation trending back toward target levels.

Growth in private demand, supported by lower borrowing costs and a resilient labor market, is forecast to recover over the course of the year. Inflation is moderating, allowing the RBA room to ease policy further if needed. Unemployment, while projected to edge higher, is expected to remain historically low, supporting continued household consumption.

However, the economic outlook is not without risks. Australia has been experiencing a "per capita recession," with GDP per person falling despite overall positive growth, and some finance experts and commentators warn of possible recession due to weak growth, high household debt, and global uncertainty. The greatest threats stem from potential external shocks: a global recession triggered by US or Chinese economic downturns, escalation in global trade tensions, or a domestic crisis such as a severe natural disaster or housing market correction. Treasury modeling and RBA scenario analysis suggest that such shocks would need to be unusually severe or sustained to tip the overall economy into recession.

The property market's resilience, anticipated recovery in household incomes, and likely policy responses are viewed as moderating factors that should help buffer against negative surprises. While some segments of the population are experiencing cost-of-living pressures and economic pessimism is widespread, these have yet to translate into the widespread declines in employment or investment typically associated with a technical recession.

In sum, while the margin for error has narrowed due to downgrades in growth projections and global headwinds, the base case remains that Australia will avoid a technical recession before 2026. Risks are meaningfully elevated, but prospective policy support, underlying economic resilience, and the absence of an imminent large-scale shock keep the probability of recession low, though not negligible.
