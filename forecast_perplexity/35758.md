Over the period from January 2025 through December 2026, the number of journalists in the US who will face criminal charges related to their work will depend on a mix of historical trends, recent legal and political climate, and the potential for unforeseen national events that could rapidly alter the landscape.

In recent years, especially following the peak of civil unrest and protests in 2020, the number of journalists arrested or charged has stabilized at substantially lower levels. Data from the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker suggests that since 2021, annual incidents of journalists facing criminal charges—distinct from mere arrests—have generally ranged from 10 to 25 per year. If these patterns persist without major disruption, the United States is likely to see between 20 and 40 journalists facing criminal charges across the two-year period, reflecting a normalized trend since the sharp post-2020 decline.

Although the US maintains robust constitutional protections for the press, these safeguards do not entirely eliminate risk. Most criminal charges encountered by journalists arise in specific contexts like protest coverage, trespassing during newsgathering, refusing to reveal sources, or alleged violations of laws such as those covering wiretapping. Freelance and independent journalists are included in the Press Freedom Tracker's count, broadening the definition and possibly raising the total compared to counts limited to traditional newsroom employees.

Experts and press freedom organizations generally expect the count of journalists facing criminal charges to stay within these customary ranges unless the country experiences a significant national trigger event. The potential for sudden spikes predominantly hinges on the occurrence of mass protests, large-scale civil unrest, or a national security crisis that triggers escalated law enforcement or governmental response. During such periods, as in 2020, the number of journalists arrested or charged can surge dramatically, with many charges often dropped but some resulting in ongoing prosecutions. If an extreme event unfolded—such as a sweeping government crackdown or a major leak investigation—totals could rise to 60 or more.

Conversely, if the US experiences an extended period of political and social calm—marked by a lack of mass demonstrations, strengthened legal protections, and judicial or legislative action favoring press rights—the number of journalists facing criminal charges could fall well below the historical average, potentially dropping to fewer than 15 across two years.

While global trends indicate rising pressure on journalists in many regions, with record numbers jailed in some countries, the US continues to stand out for comparatively lower rates of criminal charges and stronger press protections. However, factors such as continued political hostility toward the media, evolving law enforcement practices, and responses to potential crises keep the outlook uncertain. Ultimately, the forecasted total will hinge on the interplay between these stabilizing legal norms and the inherent volatility associated with times of protest, unrest, or national controversy.
