# Assessing the Supreme Court's Position on Birthright Citizenship Restrictions

The upcoming Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship represents a potential inflection point in American constitutional law. The Court is expected to rule by late June or early July 2025 on President Trump's January 20, 2025 executive order "Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship," which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the United States whose parents are either unlawfully present or on temporary visas.

## Historical and Legal Context

The current legal landscape strongly favors birthright citizenship. The Fourteenth Amendment states that "[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." This provision was specifically added to overturn the Supreme Court's 1857 decision in *Dred Scott v. Sandford*.

For over 125 years, the Supreme Court's 1898 decision in *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* has established that virtually all children born on U.S. soil are citizens, regardless of their parents' immigration status. In that case, the Court affirmed "the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory," including "all children here born of resident aliens". This precedent has remained unchallenged and consistently applied for more than a century.

## Current Legal Status of the Executive Order

President Trump's executive order, signed immediately upon taking office on January 20, 2025, has been blocked by multiple federal courts through nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court has notably maintained these stays during its review, suggesting judicial caution and reluctance to disrupt the status quo before thorough consideration.

When the Supreme Court agreed to hear the cases on April 17, 2025, it consolidated three separate challenges (*Trump v. Washington*, *Trump v. CASA Inc.*, and *Trump v. New Jersey*) and scheduled oral arguments for May 15, 2025. This consolidation indicates the Court recognizes the significant constitutional questions at stake.

## Oral Arguments and Court Signals

Reports from the May 15 oral arguments indicate a divided Court with no clear majority position emerging. Notably, much of the justices' questioning focused on procedural issues regarding the scope of nationwide injunctions rather than directly addressing the constitutional merits of birthright citizenship. This procedural focus could signal reluctance to make a sweeping constitutional ruling.

Conservative justices, despite forming a 6-3 majority on the Court, expressed skepticism about how quickly the executive order could be implemented and whether such a significant constitutional question could be decided "expeditiously." None of the justices have publicly questioned or called for overturning *Wong Kim Ark*'s core holding in previous opinions or statements.

## Legislative Context

In parallel with the executive action, legislative efforts to restrict birthright citizenship have gained little traction. The Birthright Citizenship Act of 2025, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham and Representative Brian Babin, aims to limit U.S. citizenship at birth to children with at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident. However, the bill has only 2 cosponsors in the Senate and 51 in the House, suggesting limited political consensus for such a fundamental change.

## Practical Implications

A decision allowing restrictions on birthright citizenship would have profound and disruptive consequences. It would potentially create a new class of stateless children born in the U.S. and generate complex legal and administrative challenges. The practical difficulties of implementing such a significant change might give the Court pause, especially given the absence of clear legislative direction.

## Potential Outcomes

Two primary scenarios appear most likely:

**Preservation of Birthright Citizenship**: The Court upholds existing precedent, ruling that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to essentially all children born in the United States, regardless of their parents' status. This could occur through a direct ruling on constitutional merits or through a procedural decision that leaves lower court injunctions in place.

**Restriction of Birthright Citizenship**: The Court accepts the Trump administration's argument that "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the Fourteenth Amendment excludes children of undocumented immigrants or those with temporary visas. This would allow the executive order restricting birthright citizenship to take effect, marking a dramatic shift from longstanding constitutional interpretation.

## Weighing the Evidence

Several factors suggest the Court is unlikely to allow birthright citizenship restrictions:

1. The extraordinary weight of 125+ years of precedent and consistent application
2. The Court's maintenance of lower court stays during its review
3. The divided nature of oral arguments without a clear majority for restriction
4. The focus on procedural rather than constitutional questions during arguments
5. The practical complexity and potential humanitarian concerns of implementation
6. The limited political consensus for legislative change

However, factors increasing the possibility of restriction include:

1. The Court's current 6-3 conservative majority
2. The Court's willingness to take the case for full review
3. Increased political pressure to revisit longstanding constitutional interpretations

While the probability that the Supreme Court might restrict birthright citizenship is higher now than in past decades due to the current Court's ideological composition, there remains insufficient evidence that a majority is prepared to break with over a century of precedent. Abrupt reversals of deeply embedded constitutional principles are historically rare and typically signaled well in advance.

The Court may also choose a narrower path, focusing on procedural questions about nationwide injunctions without directly addressing the constitutional merits of birthright citizenship. Such an outcome would likely leave the status quo intact while deferring the ultimate constitutional question.
