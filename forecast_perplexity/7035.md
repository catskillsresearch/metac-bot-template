The largest cultivated meat production facility in 2030 is likely to center around a baseline capacity of roughly 8,000 metric tons per year, reflecting current scale‐up plans and early commercial projects. This level represents the status quo—where standard operational and regulatory conditions are maintained without major disruption. Under this scenario, gradual improvements might modestly increase capacity to around 9,000 metric tons per year.

However, there is also strong evidence—based on both expert expectations and market analyses—that should breakthroughs occur in bioreactor technology or if accelerated regulatory approvals and capital investments take hold, a facility could scale dramatically. In these more optimistic cases, flagship facilities could reach capacities in the range of 18,000 to 20,000 metric tons per year. Conversely, should technical setbacks, regulatory delays, or financing challenges persist, even projects intended to be flagship operations may underperform, potentially falling just below the 8,000 metric ton mark.

Overall, while the most common expectation under current trends is about 8,000 metric tons per year, the potential for significant expansion exists should breakthrough innovations and supportive market conditions materialize.
