The global economy has historically maintained a growth rate of 2-4% annually, resulting in doubling times of 18-35 years. This long-standing trend forms a strong baseline expectation for future economic growth. However, the extended timeframe until 2050 introduces the possibility of significant technological advancements that could dramatically alter this trajectory.

Artificial intelligence stands out as a potentially transformative technology that could accelerate economic growth beyond historical norms. Recent progress in AI, including the development of large language models and generative AI, suggests that more advanced AI systems could emerge in the coming decades. These advancements have the potential to substantially increase productivity across various sectors of the global economy.

To achieve an 8-year doubling of gross world product (GWP), sustained annual growth of approximately 9% would be required. While this growth rate is unprecedented on a global scale in modern history, it is not entirely implausible given the potential impact of transformative technologies. In contrast, a 2-year doubling would necessitate an extreme 41% annual growth rate, which remains highly unlikely even in the most optimistic scenarios.

If accelerated growth does occur, it is more likely to manifest as a gradual acceleration rather than an abrupt jump to extreme rates. This aligns with many expert predictions of a "slower takeoff" scenario for transformative AI. Such a pattern would make an 8-year doubling more probable than a 2-year doubling as the first to occur.

The global economy's inherent inertia and the complexity of fully integrating new technologies across diverse economic systems suggest that any acceleration would take time to reach its full potential. Additionally, various factors such as geopolitical tensions, debt levels, and other economic headwinds could potentially hinder rapid growth.

While current economic projections and recent news do not indicate an imminent shift towards dramatically higher global growth rates, the long-term potential for transformative technological developments cannot be dismissed. The growing focus on AI development and other emerging technologies increases the possibility of a major breakthrough compared to past decades.

Considering these factors, while the status quo of no dramatic acceleration remains the most likely outcome, there is a non-trivial chance that an 8-year doubling could occur before a 2-year doubling or before 2050. The probability of a 2-year doubling occurring first is considerably lower, given the extreme and unprecedented level of economic transformation it would require.
