# Rationale: Will There Be a 50% Decline in Global Meat Production by 2040?

Global meat production has shown consistent growth for decades, with production increasing by 46.68% from 2000 to 2018, reaching 342.42 million tons in 2018. To determine whether a 50% decline by 2040 is plausible, we need to carefully examine current trends, market projections, and potential disruptive factors.

## Current Production Trends

The global meat market appears set to continue growing in the near term rather than declining:

- The beef market alone is projected to grow at 4.43% from 2025 to 2032, reaching USD 650.49 billion by 2032.
- World meat production is expected to increase by 41 million tons to reach approximately 382 million tons by 2032.
- This expansion trend contradicts the dramatic decline that would be necessary to reach the 50% reduction target.

## The Rise of Alternative Proteins

Alternative proteins are gaining market share but are not yet displacing conventional meat at a rate that would indicate a 50% reduction:

- By 2040, cultured meat consumption is projected to reach 30% of worldwide meat consumption.
- According to AT Kearney analysis, by 2040, conventional meat will make up only 40% of global meat supply, with plant-based meat replacements having 25% market share, and cultured meat 35%.
- Despite this growth in alternatives, it's important to note that the question specifically excludes cultivated/lab-grown meat from counting toward the reduction target.

## Structural Factors Supporting Meat Production

Several fundamental factors support continued conventional meat production:

- **Population Growth**: The global population continues to increase, particularly in regions where meat consumption is rising.
- **Rising Incomes**: As incomes rise in developing countries, meat consumption typically increases, driving global demand.
- **Production Investment**: The meat industry continues to expand production capacity, especially in emerging markets.
- **Cultural Factors**: Meat remains central to diets worldwide, with strong cultural and traditional preferences supporting continued consumption.

## Potential Disruptive Factors

Several factors could potentially disrupt conventional meat production:

- **Climate Policies**: Climate change mitigation policies could constrain meat production, though current policies appear insufficient to drive a 50% reduction.
- **Environmental Pressures**: Growing awareness of meat production's environmental impact could lead to changes in consumer behavior and policy interventions.
- **Agricultural Disruptions**: Global agricultural production could decrease by up to 35% by 2050 due to extreme weather events, geopolitical conflicts, and vulnerability of crop systems.
- **Health Concerns**: Increasing health consciousness could drive some consumers away from meat.
- **Regional Variations**: Some wealthier countries, particularly in Europe, show declines in per-capita meat consumption. In Spain, for example, meat consumption has decreased from 90 to 65 kilograms per capita over 30 years, with projections indicating a further decline to 50 kilograms by 2035.

## Market Evolution Through 2040

The global meat market is expected to undergo significant transformation:

- By 2025, novel vegan meat replacements and cultured meat will represent about 10% of the market.
- By 2030, these alternatives will grow to around 28% of the market (18% novel vegan meat replacements and 10% cultured meat).
- By 2035, alternative proteins will capture approximately 45% (23% novel vegan and 22% cultured).
- By 2040, alternative proteins will represent 60% of the market (25% novel vegan meat replacements and 35% cultured meat), with conventional meat reduced to 40%.

However, this market share shift doesn't necessarily translate to an absolute 50% reduction in conventional meat production, especially considering overall market growth.

## Weighing Historical Patterns Against Disruptive Forces

Historical patterns show global meat production has increased consistently over decades. Such entrenched trends typically change gradually rather than abruptly. While disruptive forces exist (climate impacts, alternative proteins, policy changes), they would need to accelerate dramatically to achieve a 50% reduction by 2040.

The most likely scenario based on current evidence is that conventional meat production will continue to grow in the near term, potentially plateau in the 2030s as alternative proteins gain market share, but not decline by 50% by 2040. The growth of alternative proteins will likely supplement rather than fully replace conventional meat production in this timeframe.

Given the exclusion of cultivated meat from the reduction target calculation and the continued growth projections for conventional meat markets, a 50% decline in global meat production by 2040 appears highly improbable.
