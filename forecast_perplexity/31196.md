## Rationale: Will Israel Establish Direct Governmental Control of the Gaza Strip in 2025?

As of late May 2025, Israel holds extensive military control over the Gaza Strip, occupying more than half its territory and pursuing plans to expand that control to encompass up to 75% of the area within the next few months. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has publicly declared intentions to bring all of Gaza under Israeli “security control,” and has devised detailed operational plans that include dividing Gaza into multiple zones, relocating residents to designated regions, and establishing large-scale aid distribution infrastructure. These moves reflect a strategic and infrastructural path toward long-term management and possibly deeper governmental involvement.

Israeli officials have referenced the potential to implement what’s described as “Trump’s plan” for Gaza, suggesting a reimagined governance structure or, at minimum, a significant transformation in the administration of the territory. Statements from the Israeli Defense Minister reinforce the notion of permanent Israeli presence and oversight in occupied Gaza areas.

Despite these steps and explicit ambitions, a critical distinction remains between *de facto* military occupation—which Israel already exercises—and the formal establishment of an Israeli-headed government or legal annexation of large swathes of Gaza. To date, there has been no definitive move to cross this threshold; Israeli pronouncements, while forceful regarding indefinite “security control,” stop short of outlining or initiating formal civilian or governmental rule. Historical precedent in the West Bank and Israel’s long reluctance to openly annex or administer occupied Palestinian territories directly underscore the inertia favoring prolonged military occupation over de jure governmental control.

International opposition to potential annexation or formal Israeli governance in Gaza is overwhelming and unusually unified. Major powers—including the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom—alongside the UN and humanitarian bodies, have issued stern warnings and, in some cases, threatened punitive measures. Human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have denounced Israeli strategies as violations of international law and described recent plans as aligning with crimes against humanity and collective punishment. The intensification of humanitarian suffering and accusations of genocide have increased global scrutiny, making any move to formalize Israeli government control highly contentious.

Domestic pressures within Israel further complicate the calculus—public fatigue with the conflict is widespread, and polling reveals sizable segments of the population advocate for an end to hostilities rather than expansion of Israeli rule in Gaza. Simultaneously, hardline factions within the governing coalition push for maximal territorial and administrative gains.

While the status quo is shifting toward more entrenched Israeli presence and indirect forms of population management, the leap to open, direct governmental control or annexation remains fraught with risk. Israel continues to calibrate its approach, working to maximize security and strategic advantage while managing the legal, political, and humanitarian backlash that outright governmental control would provoke.

The possibility of a sudden shift cannot be discounted, as rapid political or military developments could trigger a formal move to establish government control, especially if Netanyahu’s coalition faces existential pressures or if regional actors fail to coalesce around an alternative governance solution. Conversely, sustained international and domestic pressure, along with the profound logistical and humanitarian burdens, may keep Israel in the realm of indefinite military occupation—asserting control while deferring formal annexation or government establishment.

In sum, Israel’s trajectory in Gaza points unmistakably toward increased dominance and preparation for long-term management, but deeply rooted international, legal, and logistical barriers continue to make the crossing of the threshold to direct governmental control highly uncertain in 2025.
