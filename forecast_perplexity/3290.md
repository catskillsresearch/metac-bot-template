Multiple factors are shaping the trajectory of in vitro fertilization (IVF) births as a share of all US births by 2029. Recent data shows a steady increase in IVF utilization: in 2023, 95,860 babies were born via IVF, amounting to 2.6% of all US births, up from 91,771 IVF births in 2022. This upward trend is sustained by a combination of demographic, technological, policy, and market dynamics.

A primary driver is delayed childbearing. The average age at which women have their first child continues to rise, and fertility rates for women in their 30s and 40s are climbing, while rates for younger women fall. Older maternal age increases the prevalence of fertility challenges, which, in turn, elevates demand for IVF and related assisted reproductive technologies.

Policy developments are also accelerating IVF growth. In February 2025, an executive order aimed at expanding IVF access and reducing costs was signed, directing agencies to recommend strategies for lowering out-of-pocket expenses and broadening coverage. Though IVF remains costly—typically $12,000–$25,000 per cycle—and full insurance coverage is rare, ongoing policy attention may lead to broader insurance mandates and greater affordability, removing major barriers for many families.

The market outlook aligns with these macro factors. Industry reports project a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 7% for the US IVF sector between 2025 and 2033, with overall revenues expected to rise from $26.43 billion in 2024 to $49.12 billion by 2033. This growth is not only fueled by increasing infertility rates and postponed pregnancies but also by heightened awareness, improvements in reproductive technologies, and expanded infrastructure.

At the same time, the overall US birth rate remains near historic lows and continues to decline—down 3% in 2023 relative to 2022, with a previous annual decrease averaging 2% from 2014 to 2020. With the denominator (total births) shrinking or holding steady and the numerator (IVF births) rising, the proportion of IVF-conceived babies naturally increases.

Forecasts generally extrapolate a baseline annual growth in the share of IVF births of 0.1 percentage point per year, with some analyses suggesting annual increases in IVF births of around 4–5% or more. If current trends persist, and factoring in modest declines or stabilization in total births, projections suggest that IVF-conceived babies could account for roughly 3.5%–4% of all US births by 2029, and possibly higher should policy, technological, or cultural changes accelerate adoption even further.

However, a range of uncertainties remains. Restrictive legislation, economic downturns, or disruptive innovations in alternative fertility treatments could limit growth, resulting in a lower-than-expected IVF share. Conversely, broad insurance mandates, technological breakthroughs that improve success rates and reduce costs, or increased societal acceptance and demand for assisted reproduction could drive the proportion of IVF births well above trend estimates.

Overall, the ongoing interplay between demographic shifts, policy innovation, technological advancement, market growth, and broader societal trends will determine the precise trajectory. Yet, the weight of evidence strongly suggests a rising share of IVF births, with 2029 likely to see a historically high proportion of US babies conceived in vitro.
