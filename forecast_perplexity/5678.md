Rationale:

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's view on wanting to die by 75 is a deeply held philosophical position that he has consistently reaffirmed over the past decade, including as recently as 2025 at age 67. This stance appears to be integral to his professional and personal identity, having been central to his writings and public statements for years.

The long time horizon until the resolution date (over 8 years) introduces some uncertainty, as personal experiences, health issues, or societal changes could potentially influence his perspective. As Dr. Emanuel approaches 75, the reality of his decision may become more immediate and could theoretically lead to reconsideration.

However, several factors suggest that a retraction is unlikely:

1. Consistency: Dr. Emanuel has had ample opportunity to modify or retract his view over the past 11 years since his original essay, yet he has consistently reaffirmed it.

2. Professional expertise: As a respected bioethicist and healthcare policy expert, he has likely given this matter extensive thought over many years.

3. Recent statements: His most recent public statements suggest he still stands by the core of his original viewpoint, describing it as "more nuanced" but not indicating any fundamental shift.

4. Nature of the belief: This is not a fleeting opinion but a well-considered philosophical stance that has been publicly argued and defended.

While there's a small chance he might change his mind due to unforeseen circumstances or a significant life event as he nears 75, the preponderance of evidence suggests he is likely to maintain his position. Advances in medical technology or changes in societal attitudes towards aging could potentially influence his thinking, but a complete reversal seems improbable given the strength of his convictions.

Considering these factors, while maintaining a strong lean towards the status quo, we must acknowledge a low but non-zero probability of retraction due to the long time frame and potential for unexpected events or personal experiences that could prompt a reconsideration.
