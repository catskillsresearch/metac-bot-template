The founding members of the EU—Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Germany—are deeply integrated into the union through strong economic, political, and historical ties. The barriers to exit, particularly for Eurozone countries, are significant, making the status quo outcome of remaining in the EU heavily weighted. The EU has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges, often implementing reforms to address member states' concerns and reduce the influence of Eurosceptic movements. Economic recovery and stability further diminish the appeal of leaving the EU, as the benefits of membership become more apparent to the public.

However, a scenario leading to a departure could arise from a significant economic crisis or political upheaval, which might exacerbate existing Eurosceptic sentiments. This could result in a populist or Eurosceptic party gaining power in a key country, potentially leading to a referendum on EU membership. Alternatively, a major geopolitical event or internal EU conflict could lead to the dissolution of the EU or its transformation into a new entity. Despite these possibilities, the historical commitment of the founding members to the European project and the lack of a clear, viable alternative to EU membership make a departure unlikely. The EU's ability to adapt and reform in response to internal and external pressures further mitigates the risk of a founding member leaving before 2027.
