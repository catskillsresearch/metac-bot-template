Rationale:

The question of whether the next assassination of a sitting US President will occur after January 1, 2100, requires careful consideration of historical trends, current security measures, and potential future developments.

The status quo strongly favors a positive outcome, as there have been no successful assassinations of sitting US Presidents in over 60 years, despite numerous attempts. This long period of safety can be attributed to significant improvements in security measures, intelligence gathering, and threat prevention strategies implemented since the JFK assassination in 1963.

However, the extensive time horizon of 74+ years until 2100 introduces considerable uncertainty. This period will span multiple presidencies, each presenting new opportunities for potential attackers. Technological advancements could create unforeseen vulnerabilities or enable new attack methods that are difficult to predict or protect against. Additionally, changes in the political climate, such as increased polarization or geopolitical instability, could lead to a higher risk of extremist actions or international threats.

The compounding of small annual risks over such a long period is non-trivial, and the potential for a security breach or intelligence failure cannot be discounted. However, it's also likely that presidential security measures and intelligence capabilities will continue to evolve and improve, potentially outpacing the development of new threats.

While current news and information don't indicate any immediate heightened risk of assassination, the long-term nature of this question means that present-day indicators have limited predictive value for events decades in the future.

Balancing these factors, there is a slight lean towards the likelihood that the next assassination of a sitting US President will occur after January 1, 2100. This assessment is based on the strong historical trend of effective security measures and the expectation of continued advancements in protective technologies and strategies. However, the extended timeframe and inherent unpredictability of such events necessitate significant uncertainty in this prediction.
