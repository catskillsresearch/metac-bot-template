# Forecasting Orlando's Year-over-Year Rent Change for May 2025

Based on Zillow's data, Orlando's rental market shows a significant divergence from national trends, with the average rent in May 2025 being $2,000 compared to $2,132 in May 2024. This represents a year-over-year decrease of approximately 6.2%.

## Current Market Conditions

The Orlando rental market is characterized as "COOL" according to Zillow's market temperature assessment. This cooling trend is evident in the consistent decline in rents throughout early 2025 compared to 2024 figures. While the national rental market has shown modest growth with single-family rents projected to rise by 3.2% in 2025, Orlando is among a small group of large metropolitan areas experiencing year-over-year declines.

The downward pressure on Orlando rents appears to be persistent, with data showing:
- A continuous pattern of decline over several consecutive months
- Increasing rental concessions being offered by landlords
- Housing permits at a five-year low
- Orlando rents currently 5% lower than the national average

## Contributing Factors

Several factors are contributing to this rental market softening:

1. **Supply and Demand Imbalance**: The combination of weakened demand and potentially excess rental supply has created downward pressure on prices.

2. **Local Economic Conditions**: Orlando's economy, heavily influenced by tourism and hospitality sectors, may be experiencing unique challenges compared to the national economy.

3. **Market Competition**: With rents falling, landlords appear to be offering more concessions to attract tenants, further indicating a competitive rental environment.

## Potential Scenarios

### Low-End Outcome

A significant local economic shock could accelerate the rental decline beyond current trends. Major employer layoffs, a sudden exodus of population, or a rapid surge in new rental inventory could push year-over-year declines to 7-8%. This scenario would represent a substantial deepening of the current negative trend.

### High-End Outcome

A sudden reversal in market conditions could occur if there was an unexpected influx of new residents to Orlando or if major employers announced significant expansions. A sharp drop in new construction causing inventory to tighten unexpectedly could also help stabilize prices. In this scenario, the year-over-year change might flatten to near zero or even turn slightly positive, though current data makes this outcome appear unlikely.

## Timing Considerations

The May 2025 year-over-year rent change data from Zillow should be available imminently or within a few weeks of June 2025, as Zillow typically publishes rental data with a short lag after month-end.

Given the consistency of the downward trend in Orlando rents, barring any dramatic and unforeseen shifts in market fundamentals, the year-over-year change for May 2025 will likely remain in the negative range between -5% and -7%.
