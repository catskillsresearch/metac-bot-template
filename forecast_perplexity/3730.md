The number of communist states by 2050 will be shaped by a unique mix of historical inertia, ongoing domestic pressures, regime-specific stability, and a global context that could enable rare but dramatic change. As of 2025, there are five states—China, North Korea, Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam—that meet clear criteria for communist states, namely UN membership, explicit constitutional commitment to socialism, and single-party Marxist rule. This count has been remarkably stable since the collapse of the Soviet Union and associated regimes in the early 1990s.

In the absence of significant change, the status quo is expected to persist, with 4–5 states retaining this system through 2050. Most expert and market analyses suggest that while new communist states are highly unlikely to emerge under current trends, there is a modest risk of attrition among existing states, especially those facing deep economic and demographic challenges. China’s Communist Party appears resilient, with long-term planning and robust institutional control, though it must navigate rising inequality, environmental insecurity, and an aging population. Vietnam and Laos continue to pursue market reforms without sacrificing one-party dominance. In contrast, Cuba and North Korea face significant pressures: Cuba confronts economic hardship and generational transition, while North Korea’s isolation and internal rigidity amplify its vulnerability to shocks.

The potential for new communist states is low; decades of failed insurgencies and the global trend toward market-based and multiparty systems have created a challenging environment for new Marxist-Leninist regimes to take root. Active Marxist insurgencies in parts of Asia and Latin America have not demonstrated capacity for national takeover in the past thirty years.

However, scenarios for both sharp decline and unexpected growth in the number of communist states remain within the realm of possibility. A rapid wave of democratization—perhaps triggered by synchronous economic crises, domestic opposition, or leadership transitions—could drive multiple existing regimes toward liberalization or collapse, with the most likely to transition being Cuba and North Korea. On the other hand, major global crises such as systemic economic failure, rising inequality, or climate-driven instability could spark a new wave of anti-capitalist sentiment, enabling revolutionary movements to succeed in countries currently marked by conflict or deep inequality. Such a surge might briefly expand the number of communist states, though this is viewed as a remote possibility given the long-term trend.

Overall, the landscape is dominated by the expectation of stability or a gradual decrease, with the number of communist states in 2050 most probably falling between two and five, barring extraordinary global or domestic upheavals. This forecast rests on the combination of resilient authoritarian institutions in the strongest regimes and persistent structural, economic, and demographic vulnerabilities in the more fragile ones, within a world where the ideological space for new Marxist-Leninist regimes remains limited.
