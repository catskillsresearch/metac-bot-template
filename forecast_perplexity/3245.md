A comprehensive rationale for forecasting the U.S. average weekly hours of all employees (total non-farm private) for October 2025 is as follows:

The average weekly hours metric for all employees in the U.S. private non-farm sector has demonstrated extraordinary stability over the past decade, typically ranging between 34.2 and 34.4 hours. As of April 2025, the most recent data show an unchanged value of 34.3 hours, which has persisted throughout the early months of 2025. Across history, this measure has averaged 34.39 hours since 2006, with only brief, marked deviations during major economic disruptions like the Great Recession or the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Macroeconomic forecasters and expert models, including those from Trading Economics, anticipate continued stability in this metric through the end of 2025 and into 2026–2027. These models foresee the figure staying in the narrow band of 34.3–34.4 hours, reflecting the entrenched equilibrium of the U.S. labor market barring extraordinary events or policy shifts. No major economic shocks, policy changes, or significant structural shifts are currently anticipated that would disrupt this historical pattern as of late May 2025.

Several plausible factors could still introduce modest variation. Significant economic growth or persistent labor shortages might prompt employers to increase working hours to meet demand, potentially nudging the metric as high as 34.5–34.7 hours. Conversely, an unexpected economy-wide downturn, resurgence of a major health crisis, or widespread industrial action could reduce hours, perhaps to 34.0 or below—levels last seen during the most acute phases of past recessions.

Manufacturing-specific data for April 2025 show a slight decrease in hours worked per week, but these small sectoral shifts have not translated into broader volatility for the overall figure. Seasonal factors tend to be muted by adjustment procedures, and no significant legislative changes affecting working hours are on the horizon.

In summary, given the entrenched historical stability, alignment among expert forecasts, and the lack of visible risk factors, the most likely scenario is for the U.S. average weekly hours of all employees (total non-farm private) in October 2025 to remain within a very tight band around 34.3 to 34.4 hours, with meaningful deviation only expected in the event of a substantial and unforeseen economic or policy shock.
