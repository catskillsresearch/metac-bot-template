Semaglutide currently holds approval for obesity treatment from both the FDA and EMA, with a favorable safety profile and significant benefits, particularly in reducing cardiovascular events and overall mortality. Its extensive use in diabetes treatment provides a robust safety dataset, differentiating it from previously withdrawn weight loss drugs. The ongoing post-marketing surveillance and clinical trials have not revealed any significant new safety concerns that would outweigh its benefits. However, the historical context of weight loss drug withdrawals underscores the importance of vigilance. There remains a potential, albeit low, for unforeseen long-term adverse effects, such as an increased risk of serious conditions like cancer, to emerge from new long-term data or post-marketing surveillance. This possibility necessitates continued monitoring and reevaluation of the drug's safety profile. Given the current evidence and the time remaining until the 2027 deadline, the likelihood of semaglutide's approval being withdrawn remains low, but it is not entirely negligible.
