# Status of Arab League-Israel Normalizations: Looking Toward 2027

As of June 2025, six Arab League member states have normalized relations with Israel: Egypt (1979), Jordan (1994), United Arab Emirates (2020), Bahrain (2020), Morocco (2020), and Sudan (2020). If nothing changes in the next two years, the number will remain at six states by October 2027.

## Current Diplomatic Landscape

The Abraham Accords, signed at the White House in September 2020 during President Trump's administration, marked a landmark achievement in U.S. Middle Eastern diplomacy, leading to peace agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, with Sudan initiating a normalization process shortly after. However, momentum has significantly slowed since late 2020, with no new Arab League countries formalizing relations with Israel.

The October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and subsequent Gaza war have severely cooled normalization efforts. Despite the Abraham Accords largely surviving the conflict, their future expansion depends on broader regional dynamics. The ongoing violence has created significant regional backlash and public pressure against further normalization.

## Saudi Arabia: The Pivotal Player

Saudi Arabia represents the most significant potential normalization candidate and is widely considered the key to unlocking further diplomatic breakthroughs in the region. Prior to October 2023, Saudi Arabia was reportedly in advanced talks with Israel regarding normalization, with discussions including:

- A U.S.-Saudi defense treaty with security guarantees
- A Saudi civil nuclear program
- Significant progress on the Palestinian issue

However, Saudi officials have repeatedly stated that no normalization will occur while the Gaza conflict continues and without a credible pathway to Palestinian statehood. As reported in March 2024, Saudi Arabia wants significant concessions from Israel that would support the creation of a separate Palestinian state.

## U.S. Diplomatic Efforts

The United States continues to actively promote normalization between Israel and Arab states. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed confidence that "several" more Arab states will join the Abraham Accords "certainly before the end of this year" (2025). The Biden Administration has stated that it considers normalization of Saudi Arabia's relationship with Israel as a U.S. national security priority.

These diplomatic efforts are motivated by several strategic goals:
- Solidifying the U.S. role as regional security guarantor 
- Counterbalancing China's rising regional influence
- Creating a unified front against Iran
- Economic integration and technology sharing

## Potential Candidates for Normalization by 2027

### Most Likely Candidates:
- **Saudi Arabia**: Despite current opposition, diplomatic and strategic interests may lead to a breakthrough if progress is made on Palestinian statehood
- **Oman**: Has maintained informal ties with Israel and hosted Israeli officials in the past

### Possible Candidates:
- **Qatar**: Has maintained some commercial ties with Israel
- **Kuwait**: Could follow Saudi Arabia if the kingdom normalizes relations
- **Mauritania**: Previously had relations with Israel (1999-2009)

## Limiting Factors and Challenges

Several significant obstacles stand in the way of further normalization:

1. **The Palestinian Issue**: Many Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, have explicitly tied normalization to progress on Palestinian statehood. The "Peace to Prosperity" workshop organized in Bahrain in 2019 attempted to use economic incentives to circumvent this issue, but the Gaza war has reinforced its centrality.

2. **Ongoing Conflicts**: The continuing situation in Gaza and tensions in the West Bank have heightened anti-Israel sentiment throughout the region.

3. **Domestic Opposition**: Public opinion in many Arab countries remains strongly opposed to normalization.

4. **Geopolitical Considerations**: U.S.-China competition in the region creates complex dynamics, with the U.S. pushing Saudi Arabia to limit its relations with China as part of normalization discussions.

## Unexpected Scenarios

### Potential for Fewer Normalizations
A dramatic escalation in Gaza—such as mass displacement of Palestinians into neighboring Arab countries or a severe humanitarian crisis directly attributed to Israel—could force one or more existing normalizers (particularly Sudan or Morocco, where pro-Palestinian sentiment runs strong) to suspend or downgrade relations. This could potentially reduce the number below the current six states.

### Potential for Rapid Expansion
A breakthrough diplomatic deal—such as a comprehensive peace agreement addressing Palestinian concerns—could trigger Saudi normalization, quickly followed by other Gulf states and possibly North African countries. This scenario would require a confluence of regional stabilization, changes in Israeli policy, and significant U.S./Western incentives, potentially pushing the number to 9-10 or higher.

## Realistic Outlook

Given current trends and regional dynamics, the most likely outcome by October 2027 is a modest increase from the current six states. Saudi Arabia remains the key swing state, and its decision would likely influence several others. Without Saudi normalization, further expansion of the Abraham Accords appears limited.

If ongoing diplomatic efforts succeed in creating the conditions for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel, we might see 7-8 states with formal relations by 2027. A more extensive expansion to 10 or more states would require a significant shift in regional dynamics, including meaningful progress toward Palestinian statehood and resolution of the Gaza conflict.
