The outcome of the bet between Robin Hanson and Matthew Barnett hinges on whether whole brain emulation (WBE) or artificial general intelligence (AGI) will become economically dominant first, as indicated by the US labor force participation rate falling below 10%. The timeline for this event is highly uncertain, potentially spanning decades or even centuries, given the current labor force participation rate and its gradual historical decline.

Current expert consensus and technological trends heavily favor the development of AGI over WBE. AGI is generally considered more tractable in the near- to medium-term due to rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, which are progressing at a faster pace compared to the slower advancements in brain emulation technology. The status quo suggests that AGI-like automation will likely contribute more to GDP than em-like automation when the labor force participation rate eventually drops below 10%.

For Robin Hanson to win the bet, there would need to be significant and unforeseen breakthroughs in brain emulation technology. This would involve advancements in brain scanning, synaptic mapping, and large-scale simulation capabilities, which are currently far from being realized. Such breakthroughs would need to occur before AGI becomes economically dominant, a scenario that is currently considered less likely.

The long timeline until the bet's trigger adds an element of uncertainty, but it also provides more time for AGI-like technologies to develop and potentially dominate the economy. Given the current state of technology and expert forecasts, the probability of AGI arriving and becoming economically dominant before WBE is considered much higher, making the status quo outcome the most likely scenario.
