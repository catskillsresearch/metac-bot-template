Approximately two months remain until the USDA figures for June 2025 are published in early August 2025. Currently, the share of cage-free hens is around 40%–42%, suggesting a status quo outcome of approximately 41% if no changes occur. The trend of gradual increase in cage-free production, driven by consumer demand and retailer commitments, is expected to continue, potentially raising the percentage to around 42%–43% by June 2025. Experts and market trends support this steady increase, with expectations generally aligning around 41%–43%.

However, unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A major resurgence of avian influenza or a significant supply chain disruption could decrease the cage-free flock size, potentially dropping the percentage to below 40%. Conversely, a sudden and widespread adoption of cage-free practices by major producers, possibly spurred by new regulations or incentives, could push the percentage above 45%. These scenarios highlight the potential volatility in the market, despite the overall trend towards increased cage-free production.
