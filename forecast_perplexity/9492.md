Rationale:

The adoption of embryo selection for intelligence in Israel faces significant challenges, but also has several factors that could potentially lead to its implementation over the long term.

Currently, no country has implemented widespread embryo selection for intelligence due to ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and the limited effectiveness of polygenic scoring for complex traits like intelligence. However, Israel possesses unique characteristics that could position it as a potential early adopter of this technology:

1. Advanced IVF infrastructure and high usage rates
2. Relatively permissive stance on genetic technologies and bioethics
3. Strong cultural emphasis on education, intelligence, and technological innovation
4. History of early adoption of new medical technologies
5. Existing research in the field of polygenic scoring

Despite these favorable conditions, several significant hurdles must be overcome:

1. Current polygenic scores for intelligence offer only modest predictive power and potential gains
2. Ethical concerns surrounding the selection of embryos for non-medical traits
3. Regulatory barriers, as embryo selection is currently only approved for medical reasons
4. Potential public opposition if the practice becomes widely known or debated
5. The need for a significant increase in IVF usage to reach the >10% threshold for newborns

For this scenario to unfold within the next 274 years, several developments would need to occur:

1. Substantial improvements in polygenic scoring accuracy and effectiveness for intelligence
2. Shift in public opinion and regulatory stance to allow selection for non-medical traits
3. Widespread adoption by Israeli parents, potentially supported by government policies
4. Continued advancement of Israel's biotech sector and reproductive technologies

The extremely long time horizon of 274 years allows for significant technological and social changes, increasing the possibility of overcoming current barriers. However, it also introduces greater uncertainty, as other countries may adopt similar technologies or unforeseen factors may arise.

While the status quo is likely to persist for many years, the unique combination of factors in Israel's favor and the extended timeframe suggest a non-trivial chance of this scenario occurring. Nevertheless, it remains more probable that no country will reach this threshold, given the significant departure from current practices and the high bar set by the >10% requirement.
