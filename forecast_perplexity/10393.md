The strategic relationship between the US and India is currently on a trajectory that suggests they would likely be on the same side in a potential World War 3 scenario before 2060. This alignment is primarily driven by shared concerns about China's influence and expansionism, which have led to defense partnerships and participation in multilateral frameworks like the Quad. The historical trend of increasing cooperation, particularly in defense and strategic dialogues, supports this outcome.

However, several factors could potentially disrupt this alignment. India's policy of strategic autonomy and its historical ties with Russia present possible challenges. A significant shift in India's foreign policy, such as a deepening alliance with Russia and China, could occur due to changes in global power dynamics or major geopolitical events. Economic dependencies or shifts in strategic priorities might also lead India to align more closely with Russia and China, especially if a conflict arises where the US is directly opposed to these nations.

Conversely, scenarios involving China as a primary aggressor would likely see the US and India on the same side, given their shared security concerns. Increasing Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region or direct threats to Indian sovereignty could drive India to strengthen its ties with the US and other Western allies. Continued strengthening of defense ties, economic partnerships, and alignment on democratic values would further solidify their alliance in such scenarios.

Overall, while there are uncertainties and potential shifts in geopolitical alliances, the current trajectory and existing frameworks for cooperation between the US and India provide a strong foundation for continued alignment, particularly in scenarios involving China as a primary adversary.
