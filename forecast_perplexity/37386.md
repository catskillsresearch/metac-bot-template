Harvard University’s current ability to enroll international students under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) stems from a temporary restraining order (TRO) granted by a federal court in response to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) decision to revoke Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22, 2025. This TRO explicitly blocks DHS from enforcing the revocation and remains in effect until the court decides on Harvard's motion for a preliminary injunction, with a hearing scheduled for May 29, 2025.

The status quo heavily favors Harvard maintaining its SEVP certification at least through July 1, 2025, because federal courts are generally reluctant to make swift, disruptive changes in complex and high-profile legal disputes—especially those affecting thousands of students. Courts issuing TROs typically do so after determining there is a likelihood of irreparable harm if immediate relief is not provided, and that the plaintiff—here, Harvard—has demonstrated a credible argument on the merits of its case, with the balance of equities and public interest supporting continued protection. The severe disruption and potential harm to Harvard’s approximately 6,800 international students (roughly 27% of its student body) are a central consideration likely to influence further judicial decisions. 

Litigation involving major institutions and novel legal questions rarely concludes rapidly; it is customary for temporary court protections to persist while more thorough judicial processes unfold. Even if the court denies Harvard’s preliminary injunction at the upcoming hearing, it is likely that Harvard will appeal, potentially extending judicial stays or TROs through and beyond July 1. Thus, procedural inertia and complexity favor maintenance of the status quo over the next month.

Risks to this trajectory do exist. The government could persuade the court to deny the preliminary injunction—perhaps by emphasizing national security or legal compliance arguments—or introduce new evidence compelling the judge to side with DHS. Additionally, a successful appeal by DHS or political developments could disrupt the expected legal process. However, absent unexpected and compelling developments, courts are notably cautious in upending arrangements that could cause immediate, widespread hardship.

The legal arguments at play include Harvard’s claims that the government’s actions are retaliatory—targeted at the University’s academic independence and protected rights—and that the revocation process lacked proper procedure. DHS, meanwhile, contends that Harvard failed to meet compliance requirements and maintained a campus environment that did not meet federal standards, including serious allegations concerning student safety and conduct. While these points are crucial for the eventual outcome of the lawsuit, they are unlikely to be fully resolved before July 1, 2025.

In sum, the combination of an active court order, the slow pace of complex federal litigation, and the substantial public and institutional interests in avoiding precipitous change all point toward Harvard retaining its SEVP certification through July 1, 2025—unless there is a swift, significant reversal at the May 29 hearing or in any immediate appeals.
