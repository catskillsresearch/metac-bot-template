As of late May 2025, approximately 39% of California’s land area is experiencing drought conditions, particularly concentrated in the central and southern regions where the majority of the state's population resides, including major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego counties. This spatial distribution means that a disproportionately large share of California’s roughly 39-40 million residents are affected by drought, with estimates indicating that the drought-affected population is near or above 20 million. 

Current drought conditions have persisted and even intensified since the start of the 2025 water year, with a roughly 20% increase in drought area since October 2024. While winter storms in February and March provided only temporary relief, the predominant pattern has returned to dryness. Seasonal forecasts by authoritative agencies like NOAA and the Climate Prediction Center indicate a continuation of above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation through June and into the summer, favoring drought persistence and potentially intensification. This is especially significant given that June is climatologically among the driest months in California, making a natural drought recovery without unusual weather events unlikely.

The Drought Monitor data and historical precedent show that drought impacts extend deeply into population centers in southern California, where even modest drought coverage affects over 20 million residents due to the very high population density. The metric of drought-affected population is highly sensitive to conditions in these metropolitan areas, meaning that without a notable and sustained improvement in moisture levels—such as multiple weeks of significant rainfall or a notable storm system atypical for the dry season—it is expected that the drought footprint will remain extensive.

Possible scenarios that would reduce the drought population below 20 million depend on unseasonal, widespread, and sustained precipitation events occurring in late May or June, sufficient to significantly reduce drought classification in key populated counties. However, current climate outlooks and meteorological patterns make such events unlikely. Short-term isolated showers or localized storms, while possible, are expected to be insufficient to materially change the broader drought status.

Overall, the convergence of ongoing drought coverage in densely populated areas, seasonal outlooks favoring heat and dryness, reduced soil moisture, and the slow-changing nature of drought conditions strongly supports the conclusion that by June 28, 2025, 20 million or more California residents will still be living under drought conditions.

This rationale synthesizes the persistence and expansion of drought in primary population centers, the climatological and forecasted atmospheric conditions unfavorable to drought alleviation, and the sensitivity of the population-in-drought metric to conditions in southern California. Without a major, atypical weather shift bringing substantial precipitation, the status quo trajectory firmly points toward a significant majority of Californians continuing to experience drought on the resolution date.
