The likelihood of the U.S. passing federal legislation requiring cybersecurity for powerful AI models by 2030 is currently low, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive federal laws and the historically slow and reactive nature of the U.S. legislative process. Presently, AI regulation in the U.S. is fragmented, with efforts largely focused at the state level or on sector-specific measures, and there is no unified federal mandate addressing AI cybersecurity.

Political gridlock and prioritization of other legislative issues further hinder progress towards such legislation. Without a significant AI-related security incident, there may be insufficient urgency to drive comprehensive federal action. However, the landscape could change if a major security breach involving AI models occurs, raising public and political awareness and prompting bipartisan support for federal legislation. Such an incident could catalyze swift legislative action, especially if coupled with international developments where other countries implement similar regulations, thereby exerting pressure on the U.S. to align with global standards.

Despite these potential catalysts, the barriers to achieving federal legislation remain significant. The increasing attention to AI risks and ongoing discussions at both state and federal levels do indicate some momentum, but the probability of a legislative shift hinges on uncertain factors like major security incidents or international pressure. As it stands, the status quo outcome of no federal legislation by 2030 remains more likely.
