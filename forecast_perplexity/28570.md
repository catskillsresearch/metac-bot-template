## Rationale for IMF Global Recession Outlook Before 2026

As of late May 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the global economy is experiencing a pronounced slowdown, but still anticipates positive growth in the near term. The IMF's April 2025 World Economic Outlook revised global growth downward to 2.8% for 2025 and 3.0% for 2026, from earlier forecasts of 3.3% for both years. These figures mark the slowest pace of expansion since the pandemic and reflect a notable loss of economic momentum.

The slowdown is broadly distributed across the world's major economies. The United States, in particular, faces a significant revision, with growth for 2025 now forecast at 1.8%, a sharp drop from previous estimates. China and the euro area also face lower growth forecasts, and emerging markets have seen similar downgrades. This widespread deceleration is attributed mainly to rising trade tensions, particularly due to new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, which the IMF identifies as a "major negative shock to growth". Policy uncertainty stemming from these trade disruptions is causing a chill in business investment and consumer confidence globally.

Despite the pronounced headwinds—downgraded forecasts, trade wars, tightening financial conditions, and persistent inflationary concerns, especially in the U.S.—the IMF's baseline scenario does not call for a global recession. The projected rates, although below the historical norms, remain in positive territory. Historically, the IMF reserves the "global recession" label for periods where there is outright contraction or near-zero growth synchronously across multiple major economies—a threshold not yet met by current forecasts.

Nevertheless, recession risks are notably elevated. The IMF now assesses the probability of a global recession for 2025 at 30%, up from 17% in October 2024. For the U.S. specifically, the risk has climbed to 37-40%. While risk assessments have grown more alarmed, with officials describing the situation as a "reset" or entry into "a new era" for the global economic order, no official IMF communication has used the term "recession" to characterize the world economy as of May 2025.

The overall outlook is fragile and could worsen if trade tensions escalate further, financial markets experience heightened volatility, or additional adverse shocks occur. The IMF typically communicates major shifts in outlook through its scheduled World Economic Outlook reports, with the next significant update expected in October 2025. The timeline for a potential recession declaration is limited, with only about seven months remaining for the IMF to make such a statement before the end of 2025.

The IMF’s historical conservatism and explicit requirement for an official declaration mean that, absent a new and severe synchronous global downturn, the most likely scenario remains continued positive—if sluggish—growth, accompanied by elevated warnings but not an explicit global recession call. However, the situation is highly dynamic, and unresolved trade conflicts or unexpected shocks could force a reassessment before the window closes.
