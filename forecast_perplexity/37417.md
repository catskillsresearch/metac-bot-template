The upcoming June 2025 UN conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is designed with the explicit purpose of achieving new recognition for the State of Palestine and advancing the implementation of a two-state solution. This follows significant diplomatic momentum generated by the 2024 recognitions from Ireland, Norway, Spain, and Slovenia, which not only increased international visibility for the Palestinian cause but also created further impetus for additional recognitions and broader support for Palestinian statehood. These countries have since renewed their calls for recognition, emphasizing that only a viable Palestinian state with recognized borders can fully address the aspirations for peace and security in the region.

Despite this elevated activity, as of May 31, 2025, there are no concrete official statements, credible leaks, or legislative actions from any previously non-recognizing UN member state—such as France, Malta, or other Western European or Latin American nations—indicating an imminent recognition specifically set for June. French President Emmanuel Macron has publicly signaled that France “may” recognize Palestine during or after the June conference, reiterating the potential but consistently conditioning such a move on further political and security developments, with no firm commitment made to a June timeline.

Historically, official recognitions are rare and often well-telegraphed through advance parliamentary votes, diplomatic statements, or coordinated international efforts. The 2024 wave was, itself, a result of such coordinated momentum. While diplomatic recognitions can sometimes be announced with little advance notice, particularly at major multilateral events, the majority of similar conferences in the past have ended with expressions of support and intent rather than immediate, unilateral moves.

There are persistent rumors and expectations surrounding countries such as Malta and other moderate states, fueled by reports that up to 10 Western countries could take the step of recognition following the conference. However, these remain speculative in the absence of confirmed government plans or public commitments specifically set for June.

The status quo, in which no new UN member recognizes Palestine in June 2025, remains the most probable scenario unless there is a last-minute, coordinated policy shift. The strong diplomatic environment and the high-profile nature of the conference do increase the probability compared to a typical month, as the event is likely to serve as a platform for heightened statements and possibly set the stage for future recognitions. However, without pre-announced intentions or substantive leaks pointing to imminent action, the most likely outcome for June is continued diplomatic pressure with the momentum for recognition carrying forward beyond the conference rather than materializing as a new official recognition within the month.
