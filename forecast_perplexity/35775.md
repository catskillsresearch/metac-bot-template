The fiscal year 2028 will conclude on September 30, 2028, with data on net outlays expected shortly thereafter. The current baseline for net outlays is the FY 2024 figure of $6,751,552 million. If current trends persist, projections from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) suggest that net outlays could grow to approximately $8.11 trillion, or 22.9% of the projected GDP of $35.4 trillion by 2028. This projection assumes a 4.4% annual increase in outlays.

Expert and market expectations, taking into account potential savings from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increased interest payments, suggest a median forecast of around $7.61 trillion. However, several unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A robust economic boom could lead to higher tax revenues and reduced government spending needs, especially if DOGE's efficiency measures are successfully implemented, potentially resulting in net outlays significantly below current projections. Conversely, a severe economic recession or geopolitical crisis could necessitate substantial emergency government spending, increased social program expenditures, and higher interest payments due to rising debt levels, pushing net outlays well above current forecasts.
