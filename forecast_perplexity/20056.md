Rationale:

Argentina's economic situation presents a complex landscape for potential dollarization by 2028. The current trajectory suggests a move towards increased dollarization, but not necessarily full adoption of the US dollar as the sole legal tender.

President Milei's administration has shifted from an initial campaign promise of full dollarization to a more measured approach, focusing on a dual currency system and gradual economic reforms. This shift reflects the political and logistical challenges associated with full dollarization, as well as the need to address immediate economic concerns.

Several factors weigh against full dollarization by 2028:

1. Political constraints: Milei's party has limited representation in Congress, making it difficult to pass such a significant economic reform.

2. Gradual approach: The government appears to be taking a more measured stance, focusing on a dual currency system and other economic reforms.

3. Economic improvements: If current measures succeed in stabilizing the economy and reducing inflation, the perceived need for full dollarization may decrease.

4. Implementation challenges: Full dollarization is a complex process that would require significant time, resources, and planning to implement.

5. Concerns about monetary sovereignty: There is ongoing debate about the long-term implications of giving up control over monetary policy.

However, there are also factors that could push Argentina towards full dollarization:

1. Persistent economic challenges: If inflation remains high and economic stability proves elusive, pressure for more drastic measures like dollarization could increase.

2. Milei's ideological commitment: The president remains committed to dollarization and may push for it if conditions allow.

3. De facto dollarization: The existing high level of unofficial dollarization in the economy could pave the way for eventual full adoption.

4. Public opinion: If economic instability continues, public support for dollarization could grow, potentially influencing political decisions.

5. Time frame: There is still a significant amount of time until the 2028 deadline, allowing for potential shifts in economic and political conditions.

The status quo of a dual currency system is likely to persist in the near term, with the potential for further steps towards dollarization depending on economic and political developments. While full dollarization by 2028 remains possible, it is not currently the most probable outcome given the complex factors at play and the tendency for major economic changes to occur slowly.
