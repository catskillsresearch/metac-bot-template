China maintains a higher GDP growth rate than the United States, with recent figures showing around 5% annual growth for China versus 2–3% for the US. However, the gap in nominal GDP as of 2025 is substantial—more than $11 trillion, with the US at approximately $30.5 trillion and China at $19.2 trillion. The sheer size of this gap makes it mathematically improbable to close before 2030 under current projections, even with China's faster growth rate.

Most mainstream economic forecasts—including those from Citigroup and the Centre for Economics and Business Research—expect China to overtake the US in nominal GDP during the 2030s, “most likely in the middle of the decade,” rather than before 2030. The current growth differential, typically in the range of two to four percentage points annually, is not sufficient to close the gap within the remaining 4.5 years. For China to surpass the US by 2030, it would need to either accelerate its growth significantly beyond projected rates, experience favorable currency movements—such as a marked appreciation of the yuan against the dollar—or see the US economy encounter a severe negative shock. While possible, these scenarios would require dramatic and unlikely shifts from established trajectories.

China faces significant structural and macroeconomic challenges, including an aging population, high debt levels (with debt-to-GDP ratios around 300%), and real estate sector stresses. These factors are expected to temper China’s growth going forward and create headwinds against any potential acceleration. At the same time, US–China trade tensions and the move from export-led growth to greater domestic consumption in China introduce additional uncertainty.

Expert opinions remain divided. While some, like economist Justin Lin Yifu, have argued that China could surpass the US by 2030 “under normal circumstances,” the consensus has shifted toward a more conservative timeline, often suggesting the mid-2030s as a more realistic target for overtaking based on current market exchange rates. Notably, such forecasts almost universally refer to nominal GDP as measured in US dollars—not purchasing power parity (PPP), by which China has already surpassed the US.

Ultimately, the available data and leading economic analyses strongly indicate that the US is likely to maintain its lead in nominal GDP through at least 2029. A scenario in which China overtakes the US before 2030 would require either extraordinary Chinese growth, an unprecedented slowdown or crisis in the US, or a dramatic shift in relative currency values—outcomes that, while not impossible, are highly improbable given current trends and risks.
