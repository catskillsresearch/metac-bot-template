The question of whether a city on Earth will reach a population of over 100 million by 2100 is complex and involves numerous factors. While current trends and the status quo suggest this is unlikely, there are several key considerations to take into account.

Global population growth is expected to continue, potentially reaching 10-11 billion by 2100, with much of this growth concentrated in Africa. Nigeria, in particular, is projected to become the world's third most populous country by 2100. This demographic shift could fuel rapid urbanization, especially in cities like Lagos.

Urbanization trends are likely to persist, with more people moving from rural areas to cities. However, the nature of this urbanization may evolve. Cities might expand into vast metropolitan regions rather than remaining concentrated in traditional urban cores. This could affect how we define and measure city populations in the future.

The potential for Lagos to reach 100 million residents by 2100 is a key factor in this scenario. Some experts project that if current growth trends persist, Lagos could approach or even exceed this threshold. However, this would require unprecedented growth and overcome significant challenges.

Several obstacles stand in the way of any city reaching such an enormous size:

1. Infrastructure and resource constraints may limit growth well before 100 million.
2. Environmental challenges and climate change could impact the viability of extremely large cities, especially in coastal areas.
3. Urban planning strategies may shift towards developing multiple smaller cities rather than single mega-cities.
4. Global population growth is slowing, and some projections show it peaking before 2100.

The long time horizon until 2100 introduces significant uncertainty. Technological advancements, changes in social structures, and unforeseen global events could dramatically alter urbanization patterns and population distribution.

While the possibility of a 100 million person city cannot be ruled out entirely, the numerous practical constraints and the magnitude of growth required make this outcome unlikely. However, given the potential for rapid growth in African cities and the long-term uncertainties involved, a low but non-negligible probability is warranted.
