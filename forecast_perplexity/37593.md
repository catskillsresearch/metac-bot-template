The Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Star (Family) is shaped by a highly dynamic fan-voting process that primarily favors actresses with strong youth appeal, recent visibility, and the ability to mobilize their audiences online. The core voting demographic for the awards consists of children and teenagers, with votes cast via online platforms often influenced by social media engagement and streaming popularity.

Among the current nominees, Anna Cathcart stands out as the frontrunner, largely due to her leading role in "XO, Kitty," a Netflix series that resonates strongly with Nickelodeon’s key audience of tweens and teens. Cathcart has established significant recognition from her previous work in youth-oriented franchises, and "XO, Kitty" is both currently trending and thoroughly promoted on platforms popular with the voting demographic. Her active social media presence further amplifies her ability to rally dedicated fans for voting.

Peyton List also holds a strong position, backed by years of visibility from her role in "Cobra Kai" and her previous Disney Channel experience. Her cross-platform popularity ensures broad recognition among Nickelodeon viewers, and her established fanbase is known to be highly engaged online. Although her character might not be the central protagonist of "Cobra Kai," List’s longevity and familiarity with young audiences provide a solid foundation for votes.

Janelle James, recognized for her standout role in "Abbott Elementary," benefits from critical acclaim and the show’s widespread appeal, which extends to families who watch together. However, "Abbott Elementary" typically attracts a broader and somewhat older audience compared to the core Nickelodeon demographic. While this might hinder her baseline odds, a last-minute surge—potentially driven by an organized social media campaign or a spike in the show’s popularity—could propel her into strong contention, especially if parents encourage their children to vote based on shared viewing experiences.

Jayden Bartels represents a candidate who could capitalize on her strong social media following, especially if a viral campaign emerges in the final days of voting. Though her current show’s visibility may not match that of "XO, Kitty" or "Cobra Kai," the power of digital fan mobilization should not be underestimated in this context.

Meanwhile, Reba McEntire brings star power and cross-generational appeal, but her connection to Nickelodeon’s youth voters is not as direct—making her a longer shot for this particular award. Ryan Kiera Armstrong, though associated with notable projects, is still building her presence among the target voter base and faces stiff competition from more established nominees.

Historically, winners in this category come from shows with large, passionate youth audiences and actresses able to engage fans both through the content and digital platforms—a pattern seen with previous victors such as Miranda Cosgrove and Sofia Vergara. Streaming series like "XO, Kitty" and "Cobra Kai" have a distinct advantage due to their relevance, youth focus, and the digital savvy of their viewers.

In summary, the likely outcome favors stars at the intersection of trending youth-focused content, active social media presence, and vigorous fan engagement—while remaining open to surprise upsets driven by organized digital campaigns or significant last-minute shifts in show popularity.
