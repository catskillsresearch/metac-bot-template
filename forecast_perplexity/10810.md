Rationale:

The current geopolitical landscape strongly favors Russia maintaining its territorial integrity through 2028. As of May 2025, Russia has not only preserved its territory but has even expanded its control into parts of Ukraine. There are no significant indications of separatist movements or loss of central authority that could lead to a 20% reduction in Russian territory.

While Russia faces economic challenges, including high interest rates and a slowdown in industrial production, these issues alone are unlikely to trigger widespread separatism or territorial disintegration. The Russian government maintains firm control over its security apparatus and key economic sectors, allowing it to manage internal pressures effectively.

Historical precedent suggests that large countries like Russia tend to maintain their territorial integrity even under significant stress. The dissolution of the Soviet Union was a unique historical event, and current conditions in Russia do not mirror those of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Even during that tumultuous period, core Russian territory remained largely intact.

For a "Yes" scenario to materialize, we would need to see a rapid and severe deterioration of economic conditions, coupled with a major political crisis that undermines the central government's authority. This would likely involve a catastrophic military defeat in Ukraine, a complete economic collapse, and a leadership vacuum, all occurring within a short timeframe. While such a scenario is theoretically possible, it remains highly improbable based on current trends and the limited time horizon.

The resilience of the Russian state in the face of economic sanctions and military setbacks in Ukraine further reinforces the unlikelihood of territorial disintegration. The central government has demonstrated its ability to maintain control over its vast territory, and there are no indications of regional governments or ethnic groups seeking independence on a large scale.

Given these factors, and considering the strong status quo bias, the probability of Russia losing at least 20% of its territory before 2028 is assessed as very low. Barring a truly catastrophic and currently unforeseen series of events, Russia is likely to maintain its current territorial integrity.
