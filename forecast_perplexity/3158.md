The fundamental expectation that the first extraterrestrial life we encounter will be carbon-based rests on several robust scientific pillars. All known life on Earth, without exception, utilizes carbon as the central element in its biochemistry, benefiting from carbon’s unique ability to form stable, complex molecules through four covalent bonds. This remarkable versatility enables the vast molecular diversity necessary for processes such as metabolism, genetic information storage, and structural function.

Carbon’s chemical superiority is not just an Earthly phenomenon: it is the fourth most abundant element in the universe, and its properties—particularly the ease with which it forms long chains and rings with hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen—make it ideally suited for the demanding molecular architectures required by living systems. The CHON elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen) naturally combine to yield a wealth of complex structures, supported by additional elements like sulfur and phosphorus. This combinatorial flexibility far exceeds what’s possible with alternative elements, such as silicon, which, while theoretically able to form four bonds, creates compounds that are generally less stable and less diverse than their carbon analogs, especially in aqueous environments typical of habitable worlds.

Water as a solvent further enhances the likelihood of carbon-based life. Carbon compounds interact efficiently with water, which is also regarded as the most effective solvent for facilitating the chemical reactions necessary for life. This synergy between carbon and water is a foundation of terrestrial biology and is expected to be a common theme elsewhere, particularly because many promising environments for life—such as ocean worlds like Enceladus or exoplanets in the habitable zone—feature liquid water.

Our detection strategies and technological capabilities are deeply rooted in this paradigm. Current missions, including those of the James Webb Space Telescope, focus on identifying atmospheres containing carbon-based molecules like methane, carbon dioxide, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which have been detected at significant levels on exoplanet K2-18b. These molecules on Earth are almost exclusively biosignatures of microbial life, strengthening the likelihood that any confirmed signals are indicative of carbon-based organisms. Biosignature search methods are inherently biased toward life forms similar to those we know; thus, even if non-carbon-based life exists, our instruments are far more likely to detect carbon-based life first.

Silicon-based and other exotic biochemistries remain an area of theoretical speculation, supported by the notion that in environments radically different from Earth—such as extremely high temperatures or dry, high-pressure conditions—other elements might serve as the backbone of life. However, silicon’s chemical behavior, such as its tendency to form very stable, unreactive compounds like silicon dioxide (sand), and its limitations in forming diverse, stable molecules, make it a less plausible candidate for supporting the complexity and adaptability seen in biochemistry. Thus, the overwhelming majority of astrobiologists argue that while alternative biochemistries are not impossible, their likelihood—especially as our first discovery—is much lower.

Statistically, the question hinges not on the overall distribution of life in the universe but rather on the characteristics of the first instance we detect. Given the prevalence of carbon, the alignment of detection technology, the chemical logic of carbon-water biochemistry, and the recent suggestive discoveries of carbon-based compounds in extraterrestrial atmospheres, the most probable scenario is that our first encounter with extraterrestrial life will involve carbon-based organisms, most likely microbes inhabiting liquid water environments.

Despite the possibilities for alternative chemistries in extreme environments, the combination of carbon’s chemical advantages, cosmic abundance, and search instrument bias make it highly likely that carbon-based life will be the first extraterrestrial life we encounter.
