The likelihood of establishing an international AI regulatory agency by 2030 is currently low due to several significant barriers. The global landscape for AI regulation is fragmented, with major powers such as the US, China, and the EU focusing on their national or regional frameworks. This fragmentation is compounded by political resistance to international oversight and concerns over national sovereignty, which hinder the formation of a binding multinational AI agency. Incremental progress in AI governance is being made, but it is insufficient to meet the criteria for establishing a comprehensive international regulatory body.

A potential scenario that could lead to the creation of such an agency involves a major AI-related incident or breakthrough that prompts a global consensus on the necessity of international regulation. This catalyzing event could accelerate diplomatic efforts, resulting in the establishment of an agency with monitoring and enforcement powers, accepted by at least 20 countries. However, the occurrence of such an event is uncertain, and the geopolitical climate, along with national interests, presents substantial barriers to rapid change.

Overall, while the possibility of a transformative event exists, the current trajectory and historical trends suggest that the probability of establishing an international AI regulatory agency by 2030 remains low. The status quo heavily favors a continuation of the current fragmented approach to AI regulation.
