The current legal, ethical, and societal frameworks strongly oppose mandatory genetic engineering for all births. Presently, no jurisdictions have laws requiring such measures, and there is a robust global consensus against mandatory germline genetic modifications due to ethical, legal, and safety concerns. Historical resistance to eugenics and coercive reproductive policies further reinforces the status quo, suggesting that any shift toward mandatory genetic engineering would necessitate significant changes in societal values, technological capabilities, and political landscapes.

Technological advancements in genetic engineering are likely to continue, potentially making the technology safer, more effective, and more affordable. However, these advancements are expected to focus primarily on optional and therapeutic applications rather than compulsory genetic modifications. The pace of change in legal and ethical frameworks is typically slow, and the entrenched opposition to mandatory genetic engineering presents substantial barriers.

Scenarios that could lead to a jurisdiction enforcing mandatory genetic engineering by 2100 include a major technological breakthrough that shifts global ethical perspectives or a significant global crisis, such as a pandemic or existential threat, that alters societal attitudes and risk tolerance. In such cases, some jurisdictions might consider mandating genetic modifications to enhance human resilience or intelligence. Additionally, authoritarian regimes or highly competitive nations might enforce such laws to gain a perceived advantage.

Despite these possibilities, the probability of a jurisdiction enforcing mandatory genetic engineering by 2100 remains low. The current opposition is strong, and the absence of any precedent or movement toward such mandates suggests that the status quo is likely to persist. Unforeseen technological or geopolitical developments could alter this trajectory, but the likelihood of such changes remains minimal given the significant and enduring ethical, legal, and societal barriers.
