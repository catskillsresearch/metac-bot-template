# Will the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?

With just over 30 days remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline, Lebanon and the IMF find themselves at a critical juncture in their negotiations for a new financial assistance package. The current situation demands careful analysis of both recent developments and historical context to assess the likelihood of an announced agreement within this timeframe.

## Current State of Negotiations

Lebanon is actively engaged in negotiations with the IMF, with an official mission currently in Beirut led by Ernesto Ramirez Rigo. Technical meetings between IMF experts, World Bank representatives, and Lebanese Ministry of Finance officials have been ongoing over the past two weeks. The newly appointed Lebanese government under Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has explicitly signaled willingness to engage with the IMF as documented in the Ministerial Statement delivered in late February 2025.

President Joseph Aoun has stated that Lebanon is "committed to moving forward with implementing reforms," while Finance Minister Yassine Jaber has expressed optimism that negotiations are progressing.

## Key Reform Requirements

The IMF has consistently emphasized several critical areas that must be addressed before any agreement can be finalized:

1. **Banking Sector Restructuring**: The IMF insists on comprehensive restructuring of Lebanon's troubled banking sector, which remains the most significant hurdle.

2. **Banking Secrecy Laws**: While the government has approved amendments to banking secrecy regulations, the IMF has expressed concerns about certain provisions in the proposed laws.

3. **Fiscal Transparency and Sustainability**: The IMF requires assurance that Lebanon can sustainably repay its debts through accountable institutions.

4. **Depositor Protection**: Mechanisms for addressing depositors' rights remain incomplete and are essential preconditions for any agreement.

## Momentum and Positive Signals

Several factors suggest potential momentum toward an agreement:

- The current government appears more pragmatic and determined than previous administrations, moving from denial toward a rational approach to solving Lebanon's economic crisis.

- The IMF delegation has emphasized that Lebanon's proposed plan must gain approval from all relevant parties to pass in parliament, suggesting a roadmap for progress.

- Ernesto Ramirez Rigo has stated that "a unified financial reform plan will allow Lebanon to overcome its economic issues and unlock foreign funding," indicating potential pathways forward.

- There are additional external incentives, as substantial international aid is explicitly conditioned on both IMF agreement and banking sector restructuring.

## Persistent Obstacles

Despite positive signals, significant challenges remain:

- Lebanon did not implement most of the reforms envisaged by a previous preliminary agreement with the IMF from April 2022, necessitating a new agreement.

- Historical resistance from banking and political elites has consistently hampered reform efforts, particularly regarding banking secrecy laws and depositor compensation.

- The political system in Lebanon has traditionally been slow to build consensus across entrenched sectarian and economic interests, a process typically measured in months rather than weeks.

- The IMF maintains a rigid stance: no financial assistance is released until concrete reforms are enacted and legislative progress is visible.

## Historical Context and Time Constraints

Lebanon's track record with the IMF is problematic. A staff-level agreement reached in 2022 failed to progress to a final deal due to unimplemented reforms. The base rate for Lebanon successfully implementing IMF-required reforms within tight timeframes is low.

With only about a month remaining and several key laws and reforms still either under debate or not yet implemented, the timeline is exceptionally tight for finalizing complex negotiations and securing legislative approval for controversial reforms.

## Conclusion

While the current negotiations show more positive momentum than previous attempts, with both sides expressing urgency and commitment, substantive obstacles remain. The IMF continues to insist that Lebanon must return to fundamentals, particularly in restructuring banks and revisiting banking secrecy laws. The short runway of just over 30 days, combined with Lebanon's poor track record on reform implementation, suggests that the status quo outcome—continued negotiations without a formal announcement—should be considered the baseline.

For an agreement to be announced before July 1, 2025, not only would Lebanon need to rapidly pass and implement key reforms, but both sides would have to reach, sign, and jointly announce an economic assistance package in this compressed timeframe—a challenging proposition given the complexity of the issues and Lebanon's history of political gridlock.
