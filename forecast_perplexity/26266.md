The current technological, economic, and societal landscape presents significant challenges to the construction of a Dyson swarm, heavily favoring a "No" outcome. At present, there are no concrete plans or steps towards such a project, and the scale of industrial and technological development required is immense and unprecedented. The absence of existing infrastructure and prioritization for this massive undertaking further supports the likelihood of a "No" outcome.

While the arrival of AGI could theoretically accelerate technological advancements, the focus of AGI is likely to remain on more immediate global challenges such as climate change, economic inequality, and healthcare. The technological advancements necessary for constructing a Dyson swarm, including autonomous space manufacturing and interplanetary logistics, may not progress rapidly enough within a five-year timeframe. Additionally, societal and political factors may not align to prioritize such a large-scale project, and the world tends to change slowly, especially in the realm of large-scale space projects.

A scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome would require a rapid and unprecedented acceleration in technological development driven by AGI, coupled with a strong global consensus and mobilization of resources. This would involve breakthroughs in autonomous robotics, space manufacturing, and interplanetary logistics, with a major government or coalition of private entities prioritizing the construction of a Dyson swarm as a strategic goal. However, given the current status quo and the significant uncertainties surrounding AGI's impact, the probability of such a scenario remains low.
