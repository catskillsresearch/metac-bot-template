The likelihood of the world remaining "normal" through 2030 is relatively high, given the current probabilities and historical trends. The status quo outcome, where none of the specified disruptive events occur, is the most probable scenario. This is because the probabilities for each individual event, such as the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), significant geopolitical escalations leading to World War III or nuclear conflict, and sudden global population shocks, remain low. While there are uncertainties and potential for unexpected developments, the world tends to change slowly, and the absence of major new developments supports the expectation that the world will continue on its current trajectory. Geopolitical tensions are being managed without escalating into global conflict, and technological advancements are progressing steadily without reaching disruptive thresholds. The combined probability of none of these events occurring is significant, and the status quo is often a reliable predictor. Therefore, the expectation is that the world will remain "normal" through 2030, with no major breakthroughs or catastrophic events occurring.
