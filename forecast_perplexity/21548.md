There are approximately 18 to 19 months remaining before events up to January 2027 will definitively reveal whether a direct military conflict will occur between Russia and any NATO member state. Under current conditions, both sides maintain extensive deterrence postures and sophisticated defensive measures. Although military buildups and provocative rhetoric persist on both sides, the prevailing dynamic is one of carefully managed escalation. Russia’s operations remain largely contained within non-NATO theaters—such as its ongoing activities in Ukraine—while NATO reinforces its eastern flank and maintains rules of engagement that have so far prevented a direct, intentional clash involving uniformed forces.

A direct conflict might emerge only if a significant miscalculation or unforeseen incident occurs. Such a scenario could involve an accidental exchange of fire, an unintended incursion into critical areas like the Suwalki Gap, or a deliberate shift in military strategy that leads to an aggressive move beyond current boundaries. In these cases, an operational spillover—whether through an incursion into the Baltic states, Finland, or another sensitive region—or a rapid escalation in response to a perceived provocation could convert an otherwise contained confrontation into an open military engagement.

Overall, while the risk of an incident that triggers a direct conflict is taken seriously, the enduring commitment to deterrence and controlled escalation makes it more likely that competitions will continue in the realm of indirect engagements rather than evolving into a direct clash.
