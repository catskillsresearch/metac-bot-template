Puerto Rico’s potential path to statehood involves considerable uncertainty, both politically and procedurally. Although recent referendums and activism have demonstrated a growing majority—about 57–58%—in favor of statehood, progress toward admission as a state depends on Congressional action, which has proven difficult in a divided legislature. As of mid-2025, binding referendums and federal legislation remain pending, making it possible that Puerto Rico will not become a state by 2035, which would render the question ambiguous.

If Puerto Rico is admitted as a state before 2035 and proceeds to elect its first two senators, the local and national political dynamics make it highly improbable that both would be Republicans. Puerto Rico’s party landscape is structured primarily around status preferences rather than traditional U.S. partisan divides. The New Progressive Party (NPP), which leads the pro-statehood movement, includes factions and politicians aligned with both the Republican and Democratic parties in the U.S., while the Popular Democratic Party (PPD) promotes commonwealth status and generally leans centrist. Voters on the island have not displayed a consistent Republican tilt across recent elections or referenda, and Puerto Rico’s demographic profile—predominantly Hispanic, urban, and Catholic—broadly aligns with constituencies that tend to support Democrats at the federal level.

Organizationally, the Republican Party has limited infrastructure in Puerto Rico, and national Republican leaders have often opposed statehood, partly out of concern that Puerto Rico would not yield reliably Republican seats in the Senate. The pro-statehood NPP occasionally presents candidates with Republican affiliations, such as Jenniffer González-Colón, but it remains internally divided and not exclusively Republican-aligned. Furthermore, any transition to statehood would likely prompt a rapid realignment of parties and candidate affiliations to match the U.S. system, but nothing in current trends suggests this would produce two Republican victories in the first Senate races.

Given historical parallels—such as the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii, where initial Senate delegations were split or did not reflect a single party’s dominance—as well as Puerto Rico’s diverse and centrist political culture, a split delegation or at least one senator with Democratic or independent alignment is the most plausible scenario if statehood occurs. Only an unexpected and dramatic realignment or collapse of Democratic-affiliated institutions could plausibly result in both seats going Republican, but no evidence currently supports such a development.

In summary, the combined weight of political structures, demographic realities, party organizations, and historical precedent makes the prospect of both of Puerto Rico’s first two senators being Republicans extremely unlikely, even if statehood is achieved before 2035.
