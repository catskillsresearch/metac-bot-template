# Comprehensive Inflation Outlook: Will November 2025 CPI Be Lower Than November 2024?

## Current Inflation Trends

The 12-month US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate for November 2024 was 2.73258%. Recent data shows a moderation in inflation since late 2024, with December 2024 seeing a peak of 2.9%, followed by a decline to approximately 2.3-2.4% by April 2025. Monthly CPI increases have been running at 0.2-0.3% in early 2025, with April showing a 0.2% increase on a seasonally adjusted basis after a 0.1% decrease in March.

Core inflation (excluding food and energy) is notably lower than the headline rate, registering at 1.8% year-over-year as of April 2025. This lower core rate could exert additional downward pressure on headline inflation if energy prices stabilize or fall in the coming months.

## Competing Economic Forces

### Potential Inflationary Pressures

Several factors could push inflation rates back up toward or above the November 2024 level:

- **Tariff Implementation**: Recently implemented tariffs are creating upward price pressures as companies attempt to pass higher import costs to consumers. If these pass-through effects accelerate in the second half of 2025, they could push monthly inflation rates higher.

- **Labor Market Dynamics**: Tighter labor markets resulting from immigration restrictions could generate wage growth that spills over into broader price increases.

- **Fiscal Policy**: Tax cuts and increased government spending could boost consumer demand and potentially drive prices higher, especially if they coincide with already-tight labor markets.

- **External Shocks**: Potential disruptions in energy markets or global supply chains could reignite price pressures across various sectors.

### Disinflationary Forces

Counterbalancing these upward pressures are several factors that could keep inflation trending downward:

- **Weakening Consumer Demand**: Economic indicators show signs of slowing consumer spending, with consumer confidence declining for several consecutive months. This weakening demand limits retailers' pricing power.

- **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed has maintained a cautious monetary stance, committed to holding or potentially tightening rates if inflation flares up again. This policy approach helps anchor inflation expectations.

- **Credit Conditions**: Tightening credit conditions and declining consumer credit usage suggest reduced purchasing power, which typically translates to weaker price pressures.

- **Limited Pass-Through Ability**: Companies may struggle to fully pass tariff costs onto increasingly price-sensitive consumers in a slowing economy, potentially absorbing some of the cost increases.

## Economic Forecasts and Projections

Market-based forecasts for November 2025 suggest a CPI index value of approximately 321.74, compared to roughly 313.07 in November 2024. This would represent a year-over-year increase of about 2.75%—very close to the November 2024 rate of 2.73%.

Trading Economics models project the CPI to reach 322.98 points by the end of Q2 2025 and trend around 331.91 points in 2026. These forecasts suggest a relatively stable inflation environment through the remainder of 2025.

Several economists expect inflation to approach the Fed's 2% target sometime in the second half of 2025, based on leading indicators and the current trajectory of price pressures. If this projection materializes, it would place November 2025's inflation rate below the November 2024 benchmark.

## Likelihood Assessment

The inflation outlook presents a finely balanced picture. The economy is currently experiencing a gentle downward trend in inflation, with the April 2025 rate (2.3-2.4%) already below the November 2024 benchmark (2.73%). If this trend continues—supported by weakening consumer demand, cautious Fed policy, and retailers' limited ability to pass on cost increases—the November 2025 inflation rate will likely remain below the November 2024 level.

However, significant upside risks exist from tariff implementation, labor market tightness, and fiscal stimulus. These factors could stabilize or even reverse the disinflationary trend in the second half of 2025.

Given that inflation cycles typically evolve slowly and that recent data shows continued moderation, there appears to be a slightly higher probability that the November 2025 inflation rate will be lower than the November 2024 rate. However, the difference is likely to be marginal, with forecasts suggesting the rate will be very close to the 2.73% benchmark.

The world changes slowly: inflation trends typically take time to shift, and most upward forces (tariffs, labor costs, government spending) are being countered by monetary policy, weakening consumer demand, and cautious spending patterns. While significant volatility is possible in the intervening months, the most likely outcome is that November 2025's inflation rate will be modestly below November 2024's level.
