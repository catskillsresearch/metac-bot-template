The historical record of nuclear peace since 1945, despite numerous close calls, indicates a strong status quo bias towards avoiding global thermonuclear war. The deterrence effect of mutually assured destruction, along with international diplomatic efforts and treaties such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), has so far prevented such a conflict. Continued diplomatic efforts, effective nuclear deterrence, and international treaties are crucial in preventing the escalation of conflicts to a global thermonuclear war. Technological advancements in missile defense and early warning systems further reduce the risk of accidental launches, while geopolitical tensions are managed through multilateral dialogue and conflict resolution mechanisms, maintaining the status quo of nuclear peace.

However, the presence of risk factors such as geopolitical tensions, technological vulnerabilities, and potential proliferation cannot be ignored. A significant geopolitical crisis involving major nuclear powers could escalate beyond control, leading to a breakdown in diplomatic communication and deterrence. This could be triggered by a combination of factors such as cyberattacks on nuclear command and control systems, misinterpretation of military exercises, or a regional conflict spiraling into a broader confrontation. The involvement of multiple nuclear-armed states could result in the detonation of nuclear devices meeting the specified criteria for a global thermonuclear war.

While the probability of a global thermonuclear war is non-zero, the status quo and historical precedent suggest a lower likelihood of such an event occurring by 2070. The catastrophic consequences of nuclear war serve as strong deterrents against such a conflict, but the non-zero probability of accidental or intentional escalation, coupled with potential changes in global power dynamics, must be considered.
