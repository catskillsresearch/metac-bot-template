The development of the first AGI is an event with an uncertain timeline, as it could occur at any point in the future without a specific deadline. Currently, the landscape of AI research and development is dominated by for-profit corporations, which have consistently been at the forefront of major advancements in the field. These corporations, such as Google (DeepMind), Microsoft, and OpenAI, have access to significant resources, including vast computational power, extensive data, and substantial financial capital, which are crucial for pursuing AGI-scale projects.

The status quo suggests that if nothing changes, a for-profit corporation is likely to be responsible for developing the first AGI. This is due to their established leadership in AI research and their ability to attract top talent. However, there are scenarios where a non-profit organization, university, or government-led initiative could achieve a breakthrough independently. Such an outcome could be driven by increased government or philanthropic funding, strategic partnerships prioritizing public interest, or unique insights and methodologies developed outside the corporate sphere.

Despite these possibilities, the current environment heavily favors for-profit corporations. The recent restructuring of OpenAI into a Public Benefit Corporation, while maintaining non-profit oversight, still aligns with a for-profit model in terms of resource access and operational structure. This restructuring highlights the blurred lines between non-profit and for-profit models in AI research, further reinforcing the likelihood that a for-profit entity will play a significant role in the development of the first AGI. Therefore, given the historical trends and current status, the probability remains high that the research group responsible for developing the first AGI will be part of a for-profit corporation.
