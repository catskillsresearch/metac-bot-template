The historical trend of no offensive nuclear detonations causing fatalities since 1945 suggests a strong status quo bias against such events occurring. This long-standing absence of nuclear attacks reflects the effectiveness of global nuclear deterrence and the maintenance of international norms against the use of nuclear weapons. The United States, with its robust deterrence posture, advanced missile defense systems, and intelligence capabilities, is particularly well-positioned to prevent or mitigate the impact of a nuclear attack on its soil.

However, if a non-test nuclear detonation causing fatalities occurs anywhere in the world, it would signify a significant breakdown in these nuclear norms, potentially increasing the risk of further escalations. The US's geopolitical significance and involvement in global conflicts make it a potential target, although its strategic defenses and the severe consequences for any actor targeting the US reduce the likelihood of a successful attack.

Scenarios leading to a "No" outcome involve regional conflicts escalating into nuclear exchanges without directly involving or targeting the US. In contrast, a "Yes" outcome could result from a geopolitical conflict involving the US escalating to nuclear warfare, or a non-state actor successfully detonating a nuclear device on US soil. Despite the increased risk if a detonation occurs elsewhere, the probability of the US being directly affected remains relatively low due to its strategic importance and deterrence capabilities. Overall, while the risk is non-negligible, it is moderated by the US's defenses and the potential global repercussions of targeting the US.
