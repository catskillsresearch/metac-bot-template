The world is currently on a trajectory where nuclear weapons are likely to remain a significant component of international security strategies until at least 2075. This is primarily due to the entrenched nature of nuclear deterrence, which is deeply embedded in the defense policies of nuclear-armed states. These countries continue to modernize and, in some cases, expand their arsenals, reflecting a persistent reliance on nuclear capabilities for national security. The lack of comprehensive disarmament agreements that include all nuclear-armed states further solidifies this status quo.

Geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts contribute to the perceived necessity of maintaining nuclear arsenals, as nations prioritize deterrence over disarmament. Recent trends indicate increased defense spending and advancements in nuclear capabilities, particularly among major powers like the UK and Russia, which underscores the ongoing commitment to nuclear deterrence.

While there are movements advocating for a nuclear-free world, these efforts face significant challenges. The absence of participation by nuclear-armed states in key treaties, such as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), limits the effectiveness of disarmament initiatives. The slow pace of historical disarmament efforts and the complexity of achieving global consensus on nuclear elimination further diminish the likelihood of a nuclear-free world by 2075.

However, a scenario where the world becomes free of nuclear weapons is not entirely impossible. It would require a major geopolitical shift, such as a global movement towards cooperative security frameworks or a significant reduction in international tensions. This shift would need to be accompanied by breakthroughs in international governance and verification mechanisms, leading to a comprehensive, verifiable disarmament agreement that includes all nuclear-armed states. Such a transformation could be driven by a significant change in leadership, a global crisis that alters the security paradigm, or technological advancements that render nuclear weapons obsolete.

In summary, while the current trajectory suggests that nuclear weapons will remain a fixture of global security, the possibility of a nuclear-free world hinges on unforeseen and substantial changes in international relations and security dynamics.
