## Rationale for the Year-over-Year Rent Change in San Diego, CA, May 2025 (Zillow)

The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for San Diego, CA in May 2025 indicates a significant year-over-year decrease in rent. The data shows a drop from $3,000 in May 2024 to $2,795 in May 2025, representing a -6.8% annual change. This observed contraction stands in contrast to the national rental trend, where rents increased by 3.4% year-over-year as of April 2025, according to Zillow's national index. 

San Diego's rental market, while still classified as "warm" due to above-average demand relative to the nation and rental prices approximately 51% higher than the U.S. average, has faced unique downward pressures. The primary local factors contributing to this decline include:

- **Supply and Demand Imbalance:** Despite high demand, a combination of softening local economic conditions and an increase in available rental units has limited landlords' ability to raise rents, and in some cases, has led to aggressive pricing competition.
- **Policy Shifts:** The rollback of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) policies in March 2025, which previously encouraged new rental supply via backyard apartments, may be constraining additional supply to some extent, but the impact appears delayed and not enough to offset the current downward pressures.
- **Market Sentiment:** Experts anticipated some cooling in the San Diego housing market, but the magnitude of the rent drop in May 2025 exceeded most forecasts. While the San Diego home value index grew just 0.5% over the last year, rents experienced a much sharper correction, exacerbated by factors such as increased concessions to attract tenants and a broader slowdown in housing demand.
- **Broader Economic Context:** Nationally, rent increases persist, but several large West Coast markets like San Diego underperform relative to these averages, underpinning the region’s particular vulnerabilities at this stage of the cycle.

Potential scenarios that might lead to further declines include a rapid exodus of renters, either from high cost of living pressures or expanded remote work options, which could drive landlords to lower prices further. Large-scale economic shocks or additional policy shifts could also accentuate the downward trend.

Conversely, a significant unexpected event—such as a sudden surge in demand from new employment opportunities, a data correction by Zillow, or a disruption in competing rental markets—could lead to a less negative or even positive year-over-year change, but there is little evidence supporting this as the likely case in the current data.

Given the public availability of the May 2025 data as of early June, this assessment is based on concrete figures, with the understanding that minor future revisions or data processing adjustments are still possible. The local factors, market sentiment, and broader economic context all reinforce the observed negative year-over-year change in San Diego rent, which notably diverges from the national pattern and underscores the importance of regional dynamics in housing markets.
