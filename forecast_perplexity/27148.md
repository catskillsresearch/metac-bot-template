# Mpox Outbreak 2024-2025: Will It Exceed Previous Case Numbers?

The current mpox outbreak presents a complex epidemiological situation with several important factors to consider when assessing whether it will exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak's 66,387 confirmed cases.

## Current Status of the 2024-2025 Outbreak

As of May 2025, the mpox outbreak that began in 2023-2024 has resulted in significant case numbers, though exact global totals remain unclear. The outbreak involves the more severe Clade I (particularly the Ib variant), which appears to have enhanced transmissibility compared to the Clade IIb variant from the 2022-2023 outbreak. As of September 2024, over 29,000 cases had been reported, with over 800 fatalities (~3% fatality rate), nearly all in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The current outbreak has different geographic distribution patterns than the previous one:

- The Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to report the highest cumulative confirmed mpox cases in Africa in 2025
- Uganda is reporting 200-300 new confirmed cases weekly
- Sierra Leone has seen a dramatic surge with over 200 new confirmed cases in a recent week
- Burundi has reported a decline but still has approximately 50 new confirmed cases weekly

## Factors Suggesting the Outbreak Will Not Exceed Previous Numbers

Several indicators suggest the 2024-2025 outbreak may not surpass the previous outbreak's case count:

1. **Current confirmed case numbers**: The current estimates suggest the outbreak has reached approximately 30,000-40,000 confirmed cases, still significantly below the 66,387 threshold from the 2022-2023 outbreak.

2. **Declining trends in high-burden countries**: Uganda and Burundi are showing declining trends in confirmed cases, with Burundi reporting fewer than 50 new confirmed cases per week, down from over 200 at the peak. The DRC is showing signs of case numbers flattening.

3. **Limited international spread**: Unlike the 2022-2023 outbreak which affected over 120 countries with sustained transmission, the current outbreak remains largely concentrated in Africa with only sporadic or travel-associated cases in most other affected countries.

4. **Improved response capabilities**: Having experienced the previous outbreak, many countries have improved their response capabilities, including vaccination strategies and public health interventions.

## Factors Suggesting the Outbreak May Exceed Previous Numbers

Several countervailing factors suggest the outbreak could still exceed the previous threshold:

1. **Higher severity and transmissibility**: The Clade Ib variant appears more transmissible and potentially more severe than the Clade IIb variant that drove the previous outbreak.

2. **Significant under-reporting**: Multiple sources indicate that "the size of these outbreaks could be larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting". The actual case count may be substantially higher than official figures, particularly in conflict-affected and resource-limited regions.

3. **New hotspots emerging**: Sierra Leone has reported a rising number of confirmed cases, with over 200 new cases in a recent week. This suggests the outbreak is still actively spreading to new regions.

4. **Continued PHEIC status**: As recently as February 2025, the WHO confirmed that the mpox outbreak continues to meet the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, indicating ongoing concern about the outbreak's trajectory.

5. **Reduced testing capacity**: In some high-burden countries like the DRC, recent declines in reported cases may reflect "a reduction in testing and confirmation capacity" rather than true declines in incidence.

## Time Considerations and Resolution

The World Health Organization declared this mpox outbreak a PHEIC on August 14, 2024. The 180-day window following this declaration ended around February 10, 2025. Given that today is May 24, 2025, the outcome window has already passed, though final data compilation and reporting may still be ongoing.

## Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, it appears unlikely that the 2024-2025 mpox outbreak will exceed the 2022-2023 outbreak in confirmed cases. While the current outbreak involves a more severe variant and has significant ongoing transmission in several African countries, the overall trend in most regions is stable or declining. Without a dramatic surge in confirmed cases or major retrospective data revisions, the final confirmed case count will likely remain below the 66,387 threshold from the previous outbreak.

The weight of evidence suggests that despite concerns about under-reporting and continued transmission in certain hotspots, the geographic containment of the outbreak primarily to Africa and the declining trends in several high-burden countries make it improbable that confirmed case numbers will more than double in the time remaining before final tallies are completed.
