Since the mid-20th century the global community has relied on robust deterrence, extensive safeguards, and rigorous command‐and‐control systems to prevent any nuclear detonation outside of controlled tests. Historical experience since 1945 underscores the effectiveness of these measures, as decades of stability, clear communication protocols, and international arms‐control dialogues have kept nuclear weapons from being accidentally or deliberately used outside of the testing context.

Even in today’s environment of rising geopolitical tensions and ongoing modernization of nuclear arsenals, established norms and continuous diplomatic engagement help reinforce these safety measures. Although risks—such as misinterpretations during regional conflicts, technological or cyber malfunctions, or even potential lapses in security—remain as potential catalysts for crisis, the cumulative effect of decades of nuclear restraint provides a strong counterbalance. The steady enhancement of international protocols and security practices further diminishes the likelihood of unintended or accidental launches, while deliberate miscalculations remain heavily disincentivized by the shared understanding of mutually assured destruction.

Thus, the combination of a long-standing record of careful nuclear management, resilient international agreements, and ongoing improvements in security systems supports the view that the existing conditions will likely continue to prevent non-test nuclear detonations before 2035.
