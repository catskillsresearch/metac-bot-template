Multiple lines of evidence indicate that by 2030, the percentage of fully electric vehicles (EVs) on US roads will remain notably lower than the share of new EV sales, primarily due to the slow rate at which the US vehicle fleet turns over. The average vehicle on US roads remains in use for roughly 12 years, so even if EVs quickly climb to a high proportion of new sales, the existing stock of internal combustion vehicles means the overall transition happens gradually.

Currently, as of mid-2025, fully electric vehicles make up a low single-digit percentage (1-3%) of the total US vehicle fleet. Recent years have seen a surge in new EV sales—with figures approaching 10–11% of new sales in 2025—and major forecasts project this share to reach around 36% of new car sales by 2030. Globally, expert consensus centers on 33–40% of sales being electric in 2030, but the US is likely to lag behind China and Europe due to a mix of infrastructure and cost barriers, as well as market dynamics.

If current trends persist and market conditions remain stable, most authoritative forecasts converge on a fully electric fleet share of approximately 7–8% by 2030 in the United States. This outlook is broadly supported by projections from organizations such as the Edison Electric Institute, which anticipated about 7% of the US fleet being electric by 2030—a view echoed by multiple industry analyses and expert consensus.

There are scenarios that could materially shift this outcome. On the downside, a sharp economic downturn, persistent battery supply chain disruptions, failures in expanding charging infrastructure, or a rollback in incentives and regulations could slow new EV adoption and keep the 2030 fleet share below 4-5%. Prolonged issues in the electricity grid or surging vehicle lifespans could further dampen fleet turnover.

Conversely, breakthroughs in battery technology that significantly reduce costs and increase driving range, substantial policy support with strong incentives, rapid improvement of charging infrastructure, and sharply rising gasoline prices could catalyze a faster shift to EVs. Under these favorable circumstances, the proportion of fully electric vehicles on the road could rise as high as 12–18% by 2030, provided fleet turnover accelerates and consumer demand responds robustly.

Ultimately, while new sales shares will grow rapidly, the structure of the US vehicle fleet ensures that the share of fully electric vehicles on the road in 2030 will likely be in the high single digits, unless transformative technological, economic, or policy changes materialize in the coming years.
