The percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US by 2027 is influenced by several key factors. Currently, electric vehicles (EVs) account for about 10% of new vehicle sales in the US. If the current situation remains unchanged, this percentage is likely to stay around the same level. However, if the current trend of gradual increase in EV production continues, the percentage could rise to around 20-33% by 2027, as suggested by various industry forecasts.

Expert forecasts, such as those from BloombergNEF, project that EVs will account for about 30-33% of new US vehicle sales by 2027. The Edison Electric Institute estimates a slightly higher figure, with nearly 46% by 2030, indicating a steady increase over the next few years. These projections are based on the assumption of continued technological advancements and supportive policies.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A significant economic downturn or a major policy shift away from supporting EVs could result in a much lower adoption rate, potentially keeping the percentage of new vehicle production that is electric below 20%. Conversely, a breakthrough in battery technology leading to significantly lower costs, combined with aggressive government incentives and infrastructure development, could accelerate EV adoption, pushing the percentage of new vehicle production that is electric above 50% by 2027. These scenarios highlight the potential volatility in the market and the impact of external factors on EV adoption rates.
