Antibiotic-resistant infections are a significant and growing public health challenge in the United States and globally, but the probability that annual US deaths from these infections will double to at least 70,000 by December 31, 2025, is exceedingly low given current trends and evidence.

Over the past several years, data from the CDC consistently place US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections in the range of 35,000–48,000 annually, depending on whether C. difficile is included. This figure has remained stable without any indication of a rapid upward trend or a pending surge toward the 70,000 mark within the short remaining timeframe of seven months to the end of 2025. Historical CDC reports and recent epidemiological surveillance do not show a pattern of acceleration; rather, these estimates have fluctuated within a narrow band for nearly a decade, with no recent modeling or projections suggesting imminent doubling.

Globally, recent landmark studies forecast steady but incremental increases in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mortality, projecting that bacterial AMR could cause up to 39 million deaths worldwide between 2025 and 2050 and that annual global deaths attributable to AMR could rise from 1.14 million in 2021 to 1.91 million in 2050—a 67.5% increase. However, these projections emphasize gradual growth over decades, with the steepest rises concentrated in lower- and middle-income countries, particularly in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The US, in contrast, benefits from ongoing investments in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and robust surveillance programs that make a sudden, dramatic change in death rates highly implausible in the short term.

Any scenario that could plausibly lead to a doubling of US deaths would almost certainly involve an extraordinary and unforeseen disruptive event—such as the emergence and widespread transmission of a novel, highly resistant pathogen, or a sweeping change in surveillance definitions or reporting methodology. There is presently no evidence or indication of such an acute outbreak, policy shift, or methodological change. Media, academic literature, and CDC bulletins continue to focus on the ongoing threat of resistant pathogens and advocate for continued vigilance, but none report a crisis of sufficient magnitude or trajectory to rapidly double annual deaths.

Additionally, the typical inertia in national health statistics, combined with reporting lags and the time required for data aggregation and validation, make it even less likely that any dramatic change—if it were somehow to occur—would be recognized and officially reported by December 31, 2025.

In summary, all available evidence, expert projections, and recent trends strongly favor a continuation of the status quo over the next several months. While the future burden of antibiotic resistance is a matter of serious long-term concern, a short-term doubling of US deaths by the end of 2025 is highly improbable in the absence of extraordinary factors.
