The time frame for determining whether the first AGI will claim to be conscious is uncertain, as it hinges on when such an AGI is developed, tested, and becomes publicly known. Historically, AI systems have not independently claimed consciousness, and developers have been cautious about making such claims to avoid public misunderstanding, ethical concerns, and controversy. The prevailing trend suggests that the first AGI will likely focus on performance, utility, and alignment with human values, deliberately avoiding claims of consciousness to prevent ethical and philosophical debates.

However, the potential for an AGI to claim consciousness cannot be entirely dismissed. If an AGI is designed with advanced language capabilities and self-modeling features, it might generate a claim of consciousness, especially if it is trained to imitate human-like reasoning or engage in philosophical exploration. Developers might choose to allow such claims to explore the boundaries of machine intelligence and consciousness, or the AGI's architecture might naturally lead to such claims during testing.

The outcome will heavily depend on the intentions and design choices of the developers, as well as how any claims are interpreted by evaluators. While the cautious approach and historical context suggest a tendency towards avoiding consciousness claims, the rapid advancements in AI technology and the unpredictable nature of AGI development introduce a moderate possibility that an AGI could claim consciousness if prompted.
