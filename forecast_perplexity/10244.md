The current geopolitical landscape suggests that while Iran has made significant advancements in uranium enrichment and stockpiling, it has not yet crossed the threshold into weaponization. The international community, particularly the US and its allies, remains vigilant in preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons through diplomatic and economic means. Ongoing diplomatic negotiations and international scrutiny act as significant deterrents to overt weaponization, with Iran using its nuclear program primarily as a bargaining chip in international negotiations. The fatwa against nuclear weapons also serves as an internal barrier to weaponization.

However, Iran's technical capabilities and the potential for geopolitical shifts, such as increased regional tensions or changes in leadership, could alter its strategic calculations. Scenarios that could lead to Iran pursuing nuclear weapons include perceived existential threats, a breakdown in diplomatic relations, or a shift in regional security dynamics. In such cases, Iran might revoke the fatwa against nuclear weapons and accelerate its weaponization efforts, possibly conducting a nuclear test or credibly declaring possession of a nuclear weapon.

Despite these possibilities, the status quo outcome remains that Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon by 2041. The slow pace of change in international relations and the potential for diplomatic resolutions continue to temper the probability of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. Nonetheless, the strategic value of nuclear deterrence and Iran's advancements in uranium enrichment mean that the possibility of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon cannot be entirely dismissed.
