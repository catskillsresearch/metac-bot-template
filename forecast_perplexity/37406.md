A consistent review of recent podcast industry data demonstrates that *Call Her Daddy* maintains a robust and stable position near the top of Spotify and broader U.S. podcast charts, consistently ranking #4 according to Edison Research as of Q1 2025 and holding its place among the most-listened-to U.S. podcasts over at least two consecutive quarters. This persistent performance is reinforced by a steady stream of high-profile interviews and notable media attention, such as the recent episode with Catherine Paiz, which continues to drive significant audience engagement and cultural relevance.

By contrast, *Candace* (hosted by Candace Owens) made an impressive debut in the Top 50 at #45 in late 2024, propelled by a strong conservative media following and Owens’ existing audience, but it has not sustained a presence in the upper ranks, nor appeared in recent top-ten lists or the most current broader industry rankings. Although *Candace* demonstrated the capacity for short-term surges—evidenced by its brief overtaking of *Call Her Daddy* on March 31, 2025—there is no indication of a sustained upward trend or imminent breakout as of late May 2025.

Podcast chart volatility, while possible, is most commonly driven by major viral episodes, controversy, or significant external events. For *Candace* to overtake *Call Her Daddy* by July 1, 2025, a sudden surge would likely need to be triggered by a highly newsworthy guest, a fresh controversy, or a timely political/media event that prompts a rapid, large-scale influx of listeners. Other factors, such as significant platform algorithm changes, a technical or PR disruption for *Call Her Daddy*, or an unexpected hiatus, could also produce a short-lived ranking inversion. However, recent industry reports and news as of May 2025 do not point to any such brewing scenario for either show.

Industry forecasters generally weight the entrenched status quo heavily, especially for top-ranking shows, recognizing that audience habits and the upper tiers of podcast charts shift slowly unless a major disruptive event occurs. Nevertheless, a measured allowance must always be given for the chance of unpredictable viral spikes or external shocks that temporarily upset the order, given proven past volatility in daily chart positions.

In summary, *Call Her Daddy* enters the July 1, 2025, ranking with a substantial lead in audience reach and momentum, supported by historical data and recent media buzz, while *Candace* would require a dramatic, presently unforeseen event to overtake it in the rankings. Yet, the inherent unpredictability of viral content and daily chart movement keeps a window open for a potential—but unlikely—upset.
