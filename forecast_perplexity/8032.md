Iran's approach to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is characterized by cautious pragmatism, balancing engagement with the Taliban while withholding formal recognition. Despite increased diplomatic and economic interactions, Iran has not extended formal recognition, reflecting a status quo shaped by significant barriers. These barriers include ongoing security concerns, ideological differences, and the lack of broader international recognition of the Taliban regime. Internal political divisions within Iran and potential repercussions of unilateral recognition further complicate the decision-making process.

The potential for Iran to recognize the Taliban hinges on several factors. A significant shift in regional dynamics, such as increased recognition of the Taliban by other major regional or global powers, could influence Iran's stance. Additionally, changes in Iran's internal political landscape that favor formal recognition, or substantial progress by the Taliban in addressing international concerns like human rights and inclusive governance, might make recognition more likely.

While there are incentives for deeper cooperation, the international context does not strongly favor a unilateral move by Iran. The slow pace of change in international relations and the complexities of regional politics suggest that the probability of Iran recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan before 2030 remains moderate. However, the possibility of a shift in regional or international dynamics that could lead to recognition cannot be entirely ruled out.
