# Will a Large American City Fully Abolish Their Police Department Before 2035?

The question of whether a large American city will fully abolish its police department by 2035 requires examining historical precedents, current political trends, public sentiment, and practical considerations.

## Historical Context and Recent Attempts

The most significant push for police abolition occurred in 2020 following George Floyd's murder, with Minneapolis becoming the epicenter of this movement. Despite having a city council that initially supported dismantling their police department, Minneapolis ultimately rejected this proposal in 2021 when 56.2% of citizens voted against Question 2, which would have replaced the police department with a Department of Public Safety. This represents the high-water mark for the abolition movement, and it still failed despite unprecedented momentum.

Since that peak in 2020-2021, no other large city has pursued full abolition; rather, policy actions have shifted toward incremental reforms and "defunding" attempts, which mean reallocating police funds rather than eliminating departments entirely. Even the terminology has shifted, with public discourse largely moving from "abolish" to "reform," as even vocal critics of policing focus on accountability measures rather than elimination.

## Current Political Environment

The political climate around policing has evolved significantly since 2020:

1. Federal oversight of police departments is being deprioritized, with the withdrawal from consent decrees in cities like Minneapolis and Louisville.

2. Recent data from major cities like New York shows record lows in homicides and shootings in 2025, being attributed to effective policing strategies, which strengthens public support for traditional policing models.

3. Where police departments have come under fire through federal investigations or civil rights concerns, the trend is toward oversight and reform rather than disbandment.

## The Hanceville Example and Its Limitations

The only recent example of a recommendation to abolish a police department comes from Hanceville, Alabama, where a grand jury recommended the department be "immediately abolished" due to corruption so severe that it operated "more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency". However, this case differs significantly from what would be required for a large city to abolish its police:

1. Hanceville is a small town with only 3,000 residents, far below the metropolitan population threshold of 1 million specified in the question.

2. Even in this extreme case, the solution was to have another law enforcement agency (the sheriff's office) take over policing duties, not to eliminate policing entirely.

## Public Opinion and Practical Barriers

Public opinion research consistently shows that while many Americans support police reform, outright abolition lacks broad support. Even among Black residents—those most affected by police violence—there are concerns about the risks to public safety, which has led to resistance against abolition proposals.

From a practical standpoint, the abolition of a police department in a major city would require:

1. Strong political will from city leadership
2. Public support from residents
3. A viable alternative public safety model
4. Legal frameworks to implement such a change

None of these conditions currently exist in any major American city. The scale of operational, legal, and political challenges to fully abolishing police in a large city is enormous.

## Potential Catalysts for Change

While the probability appears low, several factors could potentially lead to police abolition in a large city:

- A catastrophic scandal involving systemic corruption or abuse in a major city police department, far exceeding what occurred in Hanceville
- Successful models of alternative public safety in smaller jurisdictions that could be scaled up
- A major, unforeseen sociopolitical shock that rapidly shifts public sentiment
- Technological developments that fundamentally change how public safety is managed

However, even with these potential catalysts, the trend of institutional inertia is powerful. Policing is deeply embedded in American governance, and disbanding such a core civic institution would require a confluence of sustained activist pressure, political realignment, new public safety paradigms, and public acceptance—a combination not currently evident.

## The Path Forward

The more likely trajectory appears to be continued reform efforts rather than abolition. Cities may pursue:
- Incremental reforms to police practices
- Selective defunding or budget reallocation
- Alternative response models for specific situations
- Enhanced accountability measures

Organizations like the Belmont Police Department demonstrate this approach, implementing policies like the "8CantWait" campaign that focus on de-escalation, duty to intervene, requiring warnings before shooting, and other reforms designed to improve policing rather than eliminate it.

Looking at the broader landscape, it appears highly unlikely that a major American city will fully abolish its police department before 2035, barring extraordinary and currently unforeseen circumstances.
