# US Life Expectancy Trends and Projections Through 2040

The US life expectancy at birth for both sexes currently stands at approximately 78.9 years as of 2025, having rebounded from the pandemic-era low of 76.1 years in 2021. Looking forward to 2040, all authoritative projections from government agencies and research institutions indicate a continuing upward trajectory rather than a decline below 75 years.

## Historical Context and Current Trajectory

The historical resilience of US life expectancy is noteworthy. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic—arguably the most significant public health crisis in a century—life expectancy only dropped to 76.1 years at its lowest point, still comfortably above the 75-year threshold. Since that low point, life expectancy has been steadily recovering, reaching approximately 77.5 years in 2022 and continuing to climb.

According to the Congressional Budget Office projections, US life expectancy will rise from 78.9 years in 2025 to approximately 82.3 years by 2055. The average life expectancy is projected to be 79.4 years for the 2025-2034 period and 81.7 years for the 2045-2054 period. These projections align with other forecasts from the Census Bureau and Social Security Administration, none of which anticipate a drop below 75 years.

## Factors Supporting Continued Stability or Growth

Several structural factors support the continued stability or growth of US life expectancy:

1. **Medical Advances**: Ongoing improvements in healthcare technology, treatments, and preventative care continue to extend lifespan.

2. **Demographic Trends**: The aging of the US population actually contributes to higher overall life expectancy figures, as the country is projected to have 95 million older adults by 2060 compared to 80 million children.

3. **Post-Pandemic Recovery**: The healthcare system has demonstrated resilience following COVID-19, with mortality rates already trending back toward pre-pandemic levels.

4. **Long-term Historical Pattern**: US life expectancy has followed an upward trajectory for decades, with temporary setbacks but no sustained periods of decline.

## What Would Be Required for a Sub-75 Year Life Expectancy

For life expectancy to fall below 75 years before 2040 would require an unprecedented and catastrophic mortality event or series of events. Such a scenario would need to:

- Produce a mortality shock significantly more severe than COVID-19
- Be sustained rather than temporary
- Affect multiple age groups simultaneously
- Overcome the existing medical infrastructure and public health response capabilities

This might include:
- A pandemic far deadlier than COVID-19
- Large-scale armed conflict on US soil
- Systemic healthcare collapse
- Severe and persistent environmental disasters
- Multiple simultaneous public health crises

None of these scenarios appear in baseline projections from any major forecasting body, and all would represent extreme outlier events.

## Pandemic Impact in Perspective

It's worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic represents a valuable reference point for assessing potential mortality shocks. Research indicates that the pandemic is projected to result in approximately 2.1 million fewer people in the US population by 2025 compared to pre-pandemic projections. Despite this significant impact, life expectancy has already begun recovering and remains well above 75 years.

The pandemic's impact appears largely temporary, with projections showing the difference between actual and counterfactual (no-pandemic) population diminishing over time, reaching about 0.4% by 2060 across all age groups.

## Conclusion

Based on current trends, historical patterns, and authoritative projections, US life expectancy at birth for both sexes is highly unlikely to fall below 75 years before 2040. The required magnitude of mortality shock would need to be unprecedented in modern American history—significantly more severe and sustained than even the COVID-19 pandemic. While uncertainty exists regarding future catastrophic risks, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that life expectancy will remain well above the 75-year threshold throughout the period in question.
