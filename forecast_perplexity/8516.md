Augmented reality (AR) technology is poised for significant growth in the coming decades, but reaching 50% adoption of personal AR devices among US adults by 2050 is far from certain. Several factors could drive substantial growth in this market:

1. Technological advancements: The pace of AR innovation is accelerating, with major tech companies investing heavily in the field. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as device form factor, battery life, and functionality.

2. Historical precedent: Smartphones achieved over 80% adoption among US adults in about 15 years. With a 24.5-year runway to 2050, AR devices have more time to overcome barriers and reach widespread adoption.

3. Diverse applications: AR has potential uses across various industries and in daily life, which could drive both consumer and enterprise adoption.

4. Generational shift: Younger generations entering adulthood may be more receptive to AR technology, potentially accelerating adoption rates over time.

However, significant barriers to widespread adoption remain:

1. Privacy concerns: AR devices may face pushback due to data collection and privacy issues, which could slow adoption rates.

2. Cost: High-quality AR devices may remain expensive for some time, limiting accessibility for many consumers.

3. Social acceptance: It's unclear whether AR glasses will become as socially acceptable as smartphones, which could impact their use in public settings.

4. Competition: Other emerging technologies, such as virtual reality, could potentially overshadow AR and compete for market share.

5. Form factor and design: AR devices need to overcome challenges related to comfort, style, and practicality to achieve widespread adoption.

The long time horizon increases uncertainty but also provides more time for potential breakthroughs and adoption. While the current adoption rate of dedicated AR devices is low, the potential for rapid growth exists if key technological and social barriers are overcome.

Balancing these factors, there is a reasonable chance of reaching 50% adoption by 2050, but it's far from guaranteed. The status quo suggests we're not currently on track to meet this threshold, but the long timeframe and potential for breakthroughs make it a plausible outcome.
