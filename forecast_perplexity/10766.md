The geopolitical landscape surrounding South Ossetia and Abkhazia is currently characterized by a strong status quo, heavily influenced by Russia's substantial military presence and political control over these regions. Historically, Russia has maintained a firm grip on both territories, and there is little indication of a shift in this dynamic. The regions operate independently of Georgian control, with South Ossetia even pursuing closer ties with Russia, while Abkhazia maintains its de facto independence.

Georgia lacks the military capability to challenge this status quo, and despite having international diplomatic support for its territorial claims, there has been no effective action to alter the situation. Diplomatic efforts have not resulted in meaningful changes, and the international community has not exerted sufficient pressure to influence Russia's position or actions.

For Georgia to regain control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a significant geopolitical shift would be necessary. This could involve a major change in Russia's internal political situation, such as political upheaval, a change in leadership, or economic pressures that lead to a strategic realignment. Such a shift might result in the withdrawal of Russian military forces from the regions. Additionally, Georgia would need to strengthen its diplomatic and military capabilities, potentially with increased international support, to establish effective governance over the territories.

However, given the current geopolitical context and the historical precedent, the likelihood of such a significant change occurring before 2028 is low. The regions' local political leadership shows no inclination towards reintegration with Georgia, and the status quo is likely to persist unless there is an unforeseen and substantial geopolitical shift.
