The prospect of a country becoming entirely vegan by 2100 is influenced by several complex factors. Currently, no country has proposed or enacted a legal ban on the consumption of all animal products, and veganism remains a minority lifestyle choice. The status quo suggests that without significant changes, a legal ban is unlikely. Cultural, economic, and logistical barriers are substantial, and there is no significant political momentum or legislative action towards such a ban.

For a country to enact a total ban on animal products, a significant global shift in attitudes towards animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and health would be necessary. This shift could be driven by major technological advancements in lab-grown meat and plant-based alternatives, making them more accessible and affordable. Such advancements could reduce the environmental and ethical concerns associated with animal products, potentially leading to a decrease in demand.

However, the challenges of implementing a nationwide ban are immense. Historical examples of major dietary bans, such as alcohol prohibition, required broad support and simpler enforcement mechanisms, which are not currently present for veganism. The enforcement and compliance challenges, along with the need for massive shifts in agriculture, food production, trade, and culture, make such a ban unlikely.

A scenario that could lead to a Yes outcome might involve a severe environmental crisis linked to animal agriculture, prompting widespread public demand for drastic measures. A country with a strong vegan movement and political will, possibly influenced by a younger, environmentally conscious population, could enact a legal ban on all animal products. This would likely be supported by international agreements or pressure to address climate change and sustainability.

Overall, while interest in veganism and plant-based diets is growing, it remains a minority position. The slow pace of change in societal norms and the complexity of implementing such a ban suggest that the probability of a country enacting a total ban on animal products by 2100 is low.
