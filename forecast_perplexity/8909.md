Advances in sequencing technology over the next two to two and a half years are expected to drive significant cost reductions in whole human genome sequencing. Under conditions where innovations continue to progress, the industry is likely to see a median cost around $118 per genome in 2021 dollars. This figure contrasts sharply with the status quo, where without further improvements, costs would remain around $200. Most expert views suggest that—with competitive pressures, incremental improvements, and scaling benefits—costs will fall somewhere in a broad range that extends from roughly the mid‐70s to nearly 200 dollars per genome.

At the same time, there are several scenarios that could shift this outcome substantially. On one hand, a major breakthrough—be it a novel sequencing method or a disruptive competitor that radically improves efficiency—could accelerate the downward trend, potentially pushing costs close to or even below the $60 mark. On the other hand, challenges such as supply chain disruptions, regulatory delays, or reduced competition could hinder progress, causing prices to remain nearer to current levels. 

In summary, while the central expectation is for costs to trend downward toward around $118 per genome, the underlying dynamics of technological innovation and market factors suggest a plausible range that could see outcomes significantly lower if major breakthroughs occur or significantly higher if external challenges persist.
