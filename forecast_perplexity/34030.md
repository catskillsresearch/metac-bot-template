Elizabeth MacDonough has served as Senate Parliamentarian since 2012, maintaining her role through both Democratic and Republican majorities—a tenure that highlights both her institutional expertise and her reputation for nonpartisan service. The office of the Parliamentarian is designed to be an apolitical one, serving the Senate as a whole rather than any individual party or leader. Her guidance is especially critical during complex legislative periods, such as ongoing budget reconciliation negotiations, where her procedural decisions determine what policies can advance under special Senate rules.

Recently, MacDonough’s ruling that EPA waivers granted to California do not qualify as "rules" under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) sparked a significant disagreement with Senate Republicans. They chose to proceed with their interpretation of the CRA and successfully voted to overturn the California waivers, openly characterizing their move as a “rebuttal to the chamber’s rules referee.” This action demonstrates that while Senate leadership is willing to override her guidance in specific cases, they have not indicated a broader intent to remove her from her post or fundamentally challenge her institutional authority.

Historically, the removal of a Senate Parliamentarian is exceptionally rare—the last major instance occurred in 2001 when Majority Leader Trent Lott dismissed Parliamentarian Robert Dove over procedural disputes that hindered a major legislative priority. Such a move is considered drastic and would represent a significant institutional upheaval, carrying potential reputational costs and unforeseen consequences for Senate norms and procedures.

Despite the recent procedural clash, several stabilizing factors keep MacDonough’s position secure:
- She enjoys longstanding bipartisan respect and is seen as a stabilizing, nonpartisan figure in the Senate.
- The majority leader and other key Senators have framed the dispute over the California waivers as a narrow and unusual circumstance, not as grounds for a wholesale rejection of MacDonough’s performance or authority.
- There have been no credible reports or indications that she is considering resignation or that a removal is actively under discussion.
- The status quo of her remaining in office is strongly favored by institutional inertia, and replacing a Parliamentarian is not a move made lightly, particularly when the Senate is engaged in complex legislative activities that require seasoned procedural guidance.

In summary, while the recent override of MacDonough’s ruling is a notable challenge to her authority, the evidence points to Senate leadership favoring isolated procedural workarounds over a disruptive personnel change. Given her long and stable tenure, strong institutional support, and the absence of any active campaign to remove or replace her, the prospect of MacDonough being removed or resigning by June 30, 2025, remains remote.
