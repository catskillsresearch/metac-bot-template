The prospect of establishing a Martian population of one million by 2075 faces significant challenges across multiple dimensions. Technologically, the development of reliable, high-capacity transport to Mars is fraught with difficulties, including the need for breakthroughs in spacecraft design, life support systems, radiation protection, and in-situ resource utilization. Financially, the costs associated with such an ambitious endeavor are immense, requiring sustained investment over decades. Logistically, the coordination of frequent and large-scale transport missions presents a formidable challenge.

Sociopolitically, the current lack of international cooperation and support further complicates the situation. A coordinated global effort is essential to overcome these hurdles, yet geopolitical tensions and varying national interests often impede such collaboration. Additionally, public interest and political will are crucial for maintaining momentum, but these can wane over time, especially in the face of competing priorities on Earth.

While SpaceX and other entities have ambitious plans, the reliance on a single corporate entity and the absence of a robust international coalition make the target highly improbable. Historical precedents of colonization and settlement efforts suggest a much slower pace of progress than what is required to achieve a population of one million on Mars by 2075. The complexities involved in establishing a self-sustaining Martian city are immense, and the current trajectory does not indicate a rapid enough advancement to meet this goal.

In summary, the combination of technological, financial, logistical, and sociopolitical challenges, along with historical trends in large-scale colonization efforts, suggests that the likelihood of achieving a Martian population of one million by 2075 is low. The status quo outcome, which is a "No," remains the most plausible scenario given the current conditions and foreseeable developments.
