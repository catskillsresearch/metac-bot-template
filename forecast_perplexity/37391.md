# Comprehensive Drought Outlook for Florida: June 2025

Florida is currently experiencing one of its worst droughts in over a decade. As of early May 2025, approximately 99% of the state was experiencing some level of drought, with only the northern portions of two counties (Escambia and Santa Rosa) unaffected. The situation has been worsening, with areas under extreme drought increasing dramatically from 4.86% to 16.87% in just one week in early May, severe drought expanding from 28.48% to 29.88%, and moderate drought almost doubling from 18.46% to 36.45%.

## Current Drought Status

The severity of Florida's drought is evident across multiple indicators:

- Nearly the entire state (99%) is currently affected by some level of drought
- Over 14 million residents (more than half the state's population) are living in drought conditions
- The drought has been classified as the worst locally in 24 years in southwest Florida and the Everglades
- By mid-May 2025, drought coverage had improved slightly to about 87% of the state, with extreme drought areas notably shrinking in South Florida

## Seasonal Transition and Forecasts

The most authoritative and recent outlook from May 28, 2025, states: "Drought is expected to be removed from Florida and the rest of the Southeast during the summer. ... The state just entered the rainy season." This represents a significant forecast for improvement and a clear change from previous expectations.

Key factors influencing this outlook include:

- Florida has officially entered its rainy season as of late May 2025
- The Eastern U.S., including Florida, is favored to see a wetter-than-normal summer according to seasonal forecasts
- May is historically Florida's third driest month, with June marking a significant shift toward wetter conditions
- The Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1, 2025, potentially bringing additional rainfall events

However, the short-term outlook from late May indicated below-normal precipitation for the Florida Peninsula in the immediate 6-10 day period (late May to early June), suggesting improvement may not be immediate.

## Timeline for Recovery

The critical question is whether enough improvement will occur by June 28 to reduce the number of affected residents below 14 million. Several timing factors are important:

- The term "during the summer" in the drought outlook is imprecise - summer officially begins June 21, giving only one week before the June 28 target date
- The extreme nature of the current drought (99% coverage initially, with significant portions in extreme drought) means recovery will take time
- Florida's climate typically allows for relatively rapid recovery once the rainy season begins, but the process is not instantaneous
- Drought improvement could be uneven, potentially leaving some populous areas still affected

## Probability Assessment

While the status quo has over 14 million Florida residents under drought conditions, the official forecast explicitly calls for drought removal during the summer. The state has entered its rainy season, which historically brings substantial precipitation capable of significantly reducing drought conditions.

However, the timing is tight - with just one month between the current date and June 28. The severity and extent of the current drought suggest that while improvement is highly likely to begin, complete recovery to below the 14 million resident threshold within exactly 30 days remains uncertain.

Given both the strong forecast for improvement and the timing constraints, there is a meaningful but not overwhelming chance that 14 million or more Florida residents will still be living in drought on June 28, 2025.
