The current trajectory of integration between Russia and Belarus is characterized by increased cooperation, particularly in economic and military areas, yet significant steps towards full incorporation remain unrealized. As of mid-2025, none of the three key conditions—passportization, a single monetary currency, and a common foreign policy—have been fully satisfied. Belarus retains its own currency, there is no widespread distribution of Russian passports, and it maintains a degree of independence in its foreign policy.

Historically, Belarus has shown resistance to fully ceding its sovereignty, and the Union State has functioned more as a cooperative framework than a true federation. The progress towards full integration is incomplete, with only about a third of planned measures completed. The status quo outcome, where Belarus retains its independence and the criteria for significant incorporation are not met, remains the most likely scenario.

However, the geopolitical landscape is dynamic, and several factors could lead to a different outcome. Russia could accelerate its integration efforts, driven by geopolitical pressures, internal political changes in Belarus, or external geopolitical shifts. This could involve widespread distribution of Russian passports to Belarusian citizens, the adoption of a single currency, and Belarus ceding control of its foreign policy to Russia. Such changes could be facilitated by increased political pressure from Russia, economic incentives, or changes in Belarusian leadership that favor closer ties with Russia.

Despite these possibilities, the slow pace of change and Belarus's historical resistance to losing sovereignty suggest that the probability of significant incorporation by 2030 remains below 50%. The leaked strategy document indicates Russia's intentions, but the realization of these goals depends on various factors, including Belarus's willingness to cede sovereignty and potential international responses. Unforeseen events could alter the trajectory, but as it stands, the status quo is likely to persist.
