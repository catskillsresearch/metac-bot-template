# Turkey's Potential Recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan

Turkey's approach toward the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) is characterized by pragmatic engagement without formal recognition. This analysis examines the factors that may influence Turkey's decision on recognizing the Taliban government before 2030.

## Current Diplomatic Status

Turkey maintains a delicate balance in Afghanistan, engaging with Taliban authorities while stopping short of formal recognition. In February 2025, Turkey handed over the Afghan embassy in Ankara to Taliban-appointed diplomats, allowing for practical relations without legal acknowledgment. This reflects Turkey's pragmatic approach to engagement while maintaining diplomatic ambiguity.

Recent developments signal Turkey's cautious stance. In June 2024, Turkey terminated its diplomatic visa exemption agreement with Afghanistan, affecting Taliban officials and suggesting a cooling in diplomatic engagement. This decision followed discussions between Turkish migration officials and Afghan authorities regarding irregular migration to Turkey and deportation of undocumented migrants.

High-level diplomatic meetings continue between the countries. In April 2025, Afghanistan's acting ambassador in Turkey met with a Turkish Foreign Ministry official to discuss expanding diplomatic ties, prisoner transfers, and visa processes. In June 2025, the Turkish Ambassador called on the Afghan Foreign Minister to deliberate on progressive bilateral ties and regional matters.

## Geopolitical Considerations

Turkey's position on Afghanistan exists within a complex regional landscape where competing influences shape policy decisions.

**Regional Power Dynamics:** Turkey has been actively seeking to expand its influence in Central Asia and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Through involvement in humanitarian aid and agriculture, Turkey aims to offset Russian and Chinese influence in the region. This fits within Turkey's wider goals in the Organisation of Turkic States and its strategic aim of becoming a leading player in the Turkic world.

**International Alignments:** As a NATO member with EU aspirations, Turkey must balance its regional interests with Western alliances. Full recognition of the Taliban would potentially put Turkey at odds with most Western powers, jeopardizing its standing with these partners and undermining its credibility on human rights.

**Regional Recognition Trends:** Recent diplomatic developments could influence Turkey's position. Russia has officially accepted the IEA's ambassador, suggesting a potential shift toward greater international recognition. Similarly, Pakistan has upgraded its diplomatic engagement with Kabul to the ambassadorial level. This regional trend of increasing engagement with the IEA could potentially influence Turkey's position over time.

## Economic Engagement

Turkey has maintained and expanded economic ties with Afghanistan under Taliban rule despite the absence of formal recognition. The IEA government signed a $6.2 million contract with a Turkish company to mine marble in Kandahar, with the mine leased for 30 years. Additionally, a Turkish company called Safir Sondaj signed an $8 million contract to drill gas wells in Afghanistan's Jawzjan province.

These economic engagements suggest Turkey is pursuing a two-track approach: economic cooperation without political recognition. Turkish construction firms have become active in Afghanistan, and Turkey has undertaken reconstruction projects in education, health, and agriculture.

## Constraints on Recognition

Several significant factors limit Turkey's ability to extend formal recognition to the IEA:

**Migration Concerns:** Turkey remains a primary migration route for Afghan refugees seeking to reach Europe, creating significant domestic and foreign policy challenges. The termination of the diplomatic visa exemption reflects Turkey's concerns about migration management.

**Human Rights Issues:** The IEA's restrictions on women's rights and education continue to be major impediments to international recognition. As recently as February 2025, foreign ministers from multiple countries expressed concern over these restrictions.

**International Isolation:** No major Western country has formally recognized the Taliban government. Turkey's international position as a NATO member creates constraints on its freedom to break with Western consensus.

## Scenarios Through 2030

For Turkey to shift toward formal recognition, significant changes would need to occur in at least one of these areas:

1. **International Consensus Shift:** Breakthroughs in international acceptance of the Taliban, such as changes in UN representation or recognition by major powers.

2. **Regional Security Realignment:** A major geopolitical shift could propel Turkey to formalize relations to protect its commercial and strategic interests in Afghanistan and Central Asia.

3. **Taliban Reforms:** Fundamental changes in Taliban governance, particularly regarding human rights and inclusion, could remove a significant barrier to recognition.

4. **Islamic World Recognition:** If influential Muslim-majority states or the Organization of Islamic Cooperation move toward recognition, this could tip the balance for Turkey.

5. **Turkish Policy Shift:** New Turkish leadership or changing domestic political dynamics could make recognition a tool for expanding regional influence.

Without these changes, Turkey is likely to maintain its current approach—pragmatic engagement without formal recognition—balancing its regional interests against international obligations and domestic concerns.
