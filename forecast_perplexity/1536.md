Rationale:

The LIGO-India project is currently under construction, with significant progress made in site selection, land acquisition, and the recent approval of a major civil construction tender. This demonstrates strong momentum and commitment from the Indian government, who view the project as a matter of national pride and scientific advancement.

The project benefits from several advantages that increase the likelihood of completion before 2028. Firstly, it builds upon established LIGO designs and experiences from existing detectors, which should mitigate some technical risks and accelerate progress. Secondly, there is robust international collaboration supporting the project, providing expertise and resources. Thirdly, the original 2025 target date allows for a buffer of nearly three years to reach operational status by 2028, accommodating potential delays.

However, it's important to recognize the challenges inherent in such a complex scientific endeavor. Large-scale projects of this nature often face unexpected hurdles and timeline extensions. The requirement to demonstrate sensitivity within a factor of 10 of specifications adds an extra technical challenge beyond mere construction completion. Potential issues could include supply chain disruptions affecting specialized equipment delivery, unforeseen geological complications at the construction site, or funding constraints.

Recent developments, such as advancements in gravitational wave detection technology and ongoing research in the field, suggest continued momentum and interest. This could help maintain the project's priority status and potentially accelerate progress.

While the outlook is cautiously optimistic, it's prudent to acknowledge the significant challenges that remain. The project's success will likely depend on smooth execution, continued government support, and the ability to quickly address any unexpected issues that arise during construction and calibration phases. If initial operations begin in late 2027 as hoped, achieving the required sensitivity by mid-2028 seems feasible, but it may be cutting it close to the deadline.
