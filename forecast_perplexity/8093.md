# Coordinated Foot Voting: Will 10,000+ Residents Move to a Single State by 2030?

The prospect of coordinated foot voting—where people intentionally relocate to increase political influence in a specific state—faces significant historical and practical challenges. With approximately 4.5 years remaining until January 2030, the evidence suggests this remains an uphill battle.

## Historical Precedent

The Free State Project (FSP) stands as the only significant modern example of coordinated political migration in the United States. Despite strong motivation and national media attention, the FSP has achieved limited success:

- After more than two decades of organized effort, the FSP moved only about 5,000 participants to New Hampshire as of 2021—roughly 25% of its original signatories
- The FSP has since stopped targeting specific mover counts after reaching its 20,000-signatory milestone
- No other political migration projects approaching this scale have emerged in recent years

This historical precedent demonstrates the enormous logistical, economic, and social hurdles involved in relocating thousands of politically motivated individuals to a single location.

## Current Landscape

As of mid-2025, there is no evidence of any new organized movement with realistic prospects for rapidly mobilizing 10,000+ intentional movers to a single state within the remaining timeframe:

- No credible media or organizational reports signal the emergence of a new project with comparable scale or ambition
- No existing effort is publicly on track to reach the 10,000-mover threshold by 2030
- The broader trends of increased polarization and flexible work arrangements have not sparked the kind of highly organized, self-documented movement required

## Structural Barriers

Several fundamental challenges make coordinated foot voting at this scale extremely difficult:

- **Logistical Complexity**: Moving thousands of people requires substantial infrastructure and resources
- **Economic Constraints**: Relocation involves significant financial costs, employment changes, and housing considerations
- **Social Barriers**: Family ties, community connections, and established social networks create powerful resistance to relocation
- **Verification Requirements**: For such a movement to be recognized, it would need not only self-reported figures but also corroboration from credible media sources

## Potential for Change

While status quo inertia strongly suggests a negative outcome, several factors could theoretically enable a successful coordinated migration effort:

- A major polarizing political event could trigger renewed interest in state-level political influence
- Continued expansion of remote work opportunities might lower practical barriers to relocation
- A new, charismatic, well-resourced movement could emerge with stronger incentives or more effective coordination mechanisms
- The FSP itself could experience a resurgence, though its current trajectory does not suggest this is likely

However, even with these potential catalysts, the lead time required to organize, recruit, and execute such a large-scale migration makes success within the remaining timeframe increasingly improbable as time passes.

## Conclusion

Given the historical challenges demonstrated by the Free State Project, the absence of any comparable new efforts, and the substantial coordination barriers involved, the likelihood of any group intentionally moving 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030 remains low. While remote work trends and political polarization could theoretically reduce some barriers to migration, there is currently no evidence of an organized effort with the scale, resources, or momentum necessary to achieve this milestone within the remaining timeframe.
