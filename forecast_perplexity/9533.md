China's current regulatory environment presents a significant barrier to the adoption of embryo selection for intelligence, primarily due to explicit prohibitions on nonmedical embryo selection and the regulatory backlash following the CRISPR baby scandal. The status quo suggests that China would not be among the first ten countries to embryo select more than 10% of its newborns for intelligence. This is compounded by the potential for other countries with more permissive regulations or less stringent enforcement to adopt the technology more rapidly.

However, China's robust biotechnology infrastructure and history of rapid technological adoption indicate that a shift in policy could lead to a different outcome. Factors such as technological advancements, changes in public opinion, or geopolitical pressures to maintain a competitive edge in biotechnology could drive a significant policy shift. If regulations were relaxed or enforcement weakened, China could quickly advance in this area, potentially becoming one of the first ten countries to reach the threshold.

Despite these possibilities, the slow pace of regulatory change and the complexity of ethical considerations make the status quo outcome more likely in the near term. Nonetheless, the potential for long-term shifts in policy or enforcement cannot be entirely ruled out, given China's capacity for swift policy changes in response to technological and geopolitical developments.
