# Donald Trump's Economic Approval Rating: Forecast for June 25, 2025

As of late May 2025, Donald Trump's net approval rating on the economy stands firmly in negative territory. Recent polling data indicates his economic approval is around -11 points (42% approve, 53% disapprove), which represents a modest improvement from April lows but remains a significant liability compared to his first term.

## Current State of Trump's Economic Approval

Trump's economic approval has stabilized in recent weeks after experiencing a significant decline earlier in the spring. This stabilization follows a pattern where his approval ratings initially showed a "mirror image" reversal from early +7% to around -7%, before settling into worse territory. According to the Silver Bulletin and corroborating polls, his economic approval is currently in the range of -10% to -13%.

Several key factors are currently influencing public perception of Trump's economic management:

1. **Tariff Policy**: Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping new tariffs ("Liberation Day") caused market volatility and triggered a sharp decline in his approval ratings. His recent decision to delay imposing 50% tariffs on EU imports until July 9 has been received more positively by markets, contributing to a slight rebound in approval.

2. **Tax Legislation**: While Trump's administration has passed significant tax cuts, the Congressional Budget Office estimates this will add approximately $3.8 trillion to federal debt over the next decade, creating concerns about future Treasury bond issuances and dollar strength.

3. **Consumer Sentiment**: Despite some policy wins, consumer sentiment remains mixed, with inflation being a significant concern. Polling shows 66% of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of inflation specifically.

## Projecting Forward to June 25

With 28 days until June 25, several factors could influence Trump's economic approval rating:

### Potential Positive Developments
- Continued progress in EU trade negotiations could improve market sentiment
- Favorable May economic data (jobs report, inflation figures) to be released in early June
- The modest rebound seen in late May could continue if markets respond positively to policy shifts

### Potential Negative Factors
- Persistent concerns about inflation could continue to drag down approval
- Market volatility related to ongoing tariff uncertainty
- Growing concerns about deficit impacts from tax cuts

The federal Reserve meeting in mid-June and preliminary Q2 GDP estimates could also significantly influence public perception of the economy before June 25.

## Historical Context and Patterns

Trump's economic approval is currently described as "worse than every other president in our historical database except for Trump 1.0," indicating this is a historically poor position. Even Republicans are less unanimous on economic approval than overall job approval, with polls showing independents' economic ratings trending downward.

Polling volatility is typically modest barring true economic shocks, as voters tend to update their economic perceptions relatively slowly. The recent stabilization suggests that, absent major developments, large swings in either direction are unlikely in the short term.

## Most Likely Outcome

Based on the current trajectory, recent stabilization, and the relatively short timeframe until June 25, Trump's net approval on the economy will most likely remain in the -15% to -10% range. There is a meaningful but smaller chance it could improve to between -10% and -5% if positive economic indicators emerge or trade negotiations show substantial progress.

The probability of a dramatic improvement to -5% or better is quite low, requiring a sudden, major breakthrough in trade talks or unexpectedly positive economic data. Similarly, further deterioration below -15% would likely require a significant negative shock such as a market downturn, recession confirmation, or major policy failure.

In the absence of such shocks, the inertia in public opinion and the "stickiness" of economic approval ratings suggest that Trump's net economic approval on June 25, 2025, will most likely fall between -15% and -10%, continuing the pattern of economic issues being a substantial liability for his administration.
