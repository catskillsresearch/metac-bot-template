The current state of research on NAD+ boosters and their potential to increase human lifespan by ≥5% is characterized by significant challenges and limitations. As of now, there is no direct evidence from human trials supporting such an effect, and systematic reviews have not concluded otherwise. The primary focus of existing human clinical trials remains on short-term biomarkers and surrogate outcomes rather than direct lifespan measurements. This focus is largely due to the logistical and ethical complexities inherent in conducting long-term human lifespan studies.

For a scenario where NAD+ boosters are shown to increase human lifespan by ≥5% by 2030, a substantial shift in research methodology and focus would be necessary. This would involve breakthroughs in clinical trial design or technology that allow for the rapid assessment of long-term effects, coupled with significant increases in funding and policy support to initiate large-scale, long-term human trials. Such trials would need to provide robust evidence of lifespan extension, leading to systematic reviews that confirm these findings.

However, given the current trajectory of research and the slow pace of change in areas requiring extensive ethical considerations and long-term studies, the likelihood of achieving the necessary breakthroughs and evidence within the next 4.5 years is low. The status quo outcome, which is a No, remains the most probable scenario, as the world tends to change gradually, especially in fields as complex as human lifespan research.
