The question of whether any country will have a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) below 0.5 before 2053 involves a complex interplay of demographic trends, policy interventions, and socio-economic factors. Currently, no country has been reported with a TFR below this threshold, and major demographic forecasting organizations like the UN World Population Prospects have not projected such a decline. Their models implicitly assume a lower bound of 0.5, reflecting a status quo outcome of "No."

However, the persistent decline in fertility rates in certain East Asian countries, such as South Korea, Hong Kong, and Macau, challenges these assumptions. These regions have experienced significant socio-economic pressures, cultural norms discouraging childbearing, and ineffective policy interventions, all contributing to their low fertility rates. Historical trends have shown that conventional models often fail to predict the extent of these declines accurately, suggesting that a TFR below 0.5 is plausible.

The 28-year time horizon until 2053 allows for substantial demographic shifts. While the potential for policy interventions or societal changes to stabilize or increase fertility rates exists, the deeply entrenched factors contributing to low fertility in some regions may continue to exert downward pressure. The possibility of methodological updates by demographic organizations to reflect these realities could also influence future projections.

In summary, while the status quo suggests a "No" outcome, the combination of persistent low fertility trends in certain regions and the potential for significant demographic changes over the next few decades indicates a moderate probability of a "Yes" outcome. The inherent uncertainty in long-term demographic forecasting and the potential for unforeseen interventions or societal shifts should be considered in assessing this probability.
