The current geopolitical landscape and NATO's established policies strongly suggest that the deployment of NATO combat troops to Ukraine before 2027 is unlikely. NATO has consistently maintained a policy of non-deployment of combat troops in Ukraine, primarily due to the significant risks of escalation with Russia, which possesses nuclear capabilities. Key NATO members, particularly the US and UK, have expressed strong opposition to direct military involvement, reinforcing the status quo of supporting Ukraine through non-combat means such as military aid and training outside of Ukraine.

The continuation of the conflict without a formal peace agreement further solidifies the likelihood of a "No" outcome, as NATO remains cautious about provoking a direct confrontation with Russia. Even in the event of a peace agreement, NATO may opt for alternative security measures, such as providing military aid or training, rather than deploying combat troops.

However, a potential shift could occur if a peace agreement is reached, leaving uncontested Ukrainian territory under Kyiv's control. In such a scenario, NATO or individual member states might consider deploying combat troops as part of a stabilization or deterrence mission to ensure regional stability and deter further aggression. This would require a significant change in the current NATO consensus and a reassessment of the geopolitical landscape, which remains speculative at this point.

Overall, the historical trend of NATO's cautious approach, combined with the strong internal opposition to direct military involvement in Ukraine, supports the likelihood of a "No" outcome. Nonetheless, the possibility of a "Yes" outcome hinges on future developments, particularly the achievement of a peace agreement and the subsequent need for stabilization efforts.
