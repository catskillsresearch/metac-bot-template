Over the next 14 years, the prospect of Turkey joining the European Union (EU) as a full member faces substantial and multifaceted obstacles. The accession process has been officially frozen since 2018 and reaffirmed as such by the European Parliament as recently as May 2025, with clear statements that Turkey’s path to membership is blocked primarily due to its ongoing democratic backsliding, persistent human rights violations, and repeated failures to adhere to the rule of law. These issues directly contravene the Copenhagen Criteria, which are the EU’s fundamental and non-negotiable requirements for accession, including stable democratic institutions, respect for human rights, the protection of minorities, and alignment with EU foreign and security policy.

Political disputes remain another core barrier. The unresolved Cyprus dispute, ongoing tensions with Greece (both EU members with veto power), and growing skepticism among key EU states such as France and Germany further entrench the stalemate. The European Parliament has explicitly condemned unilateral actions by Turkish leadership in Cyprus and noted that such provocations only worsen an already fraught relationship.

Although Turkey retains strategic significance for the EU—as a NATO ally, a critical partner in migration management, and a key actor in regional security and trade—the EU has explicitly separated this practical cooperation from the question of accession. Strategic and transactional engagement in areas like migration, security, and energy has continued and may even deepen, but it is not seen as a substitute for the political and institutional convergence required for full membership. EU institutions and member states have repeatedly stated that geopolitical or economic benefits do not override the absolute nature of accession criteria.

The only plausible path toward membership would require a transformative political shift within Turkey: a reversal of democratic backsliding, sweeping reforms to restore the rule of law and human rights, and meaningful progress toward resolving disputes with Cyprus and Greece. Simultaneously, the EU would need to recalibrate its enlargement priorities—potentially in response to dramatic geopolitical changes—to prioritize Turkey’s accession and overcome internal skepticism. Achieving unanimous approval from all existing member states remains a formidable hurdle.

Despite the persistence of these challenges, some positive undercurrents remain. The pro-European aspirations of significant segments of Turkish society, especially among its youth, are cited by EU officials as a reason to keep the accession process nominally alive. Nonetheless, this is recognized more as a symbolic gesture than a realistic path to membership under current and foreseeable conditions.

Given these entrenched structural impediments—democratic deterioration in Turkey, unresolved regional disputes, firm opposition from influential EU states, and the EU’s unyielding standards on accession—it is overwhelmingly likely that Turkey will remain a candidate country with its accession process in a state of indefinite suspension. Transactional relations and sectoral cooperation are set to persist, but without the political or institutional transformation necessary for EU membership by 2040.
