# Consumer Sentiment Outlook: June 2025 University of Michigan Report

The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index remained unchanged at 52.2 in May 2025, ending four consecutive months of declining sentiment. This represents the fourth lowest reading on record and a significant 24.5% decrease from May 2024, when the index stood at 69.1. For the June 2025 report to exceed 60.0, the index would need to increase by 7.8 points (approximately 15%) in a single month, which would be a historically unusual movement.

## Current Economic Context

Consumer sentiment has stabilized at a low level following months of decline, with no month in 2025 exceeding 57.0. The stabilization in May came after the preliminary reading showed a dip to 50.8, but sentiment improved in the latter half of the month following the temporary pause on some tariffs on Chinese goods. However, this modest positive development was offset by ongoing concerns:

- **Personal Financial Strain**: Declines in current personal finances stemming from stagnating incomes throughout May have continued to depress sentiment.
- **Persistent Inflation Worries**: Year-ahead inflation expectations remain elevated at 6.6%, continuing to weigh heavily on consumer outlook.
- **Labor Market Concerns**: Recent reports indicate significant slowing in job growth, with private-sector hiring adding only 37,000 jobs in May, the slowest pace in over two years.
- **Component Breakdown**: The Current Economic Conditions component actually decreased further in May (to 58.9 from 59.8), even as expectations slightly improved (47.9 from 47.3).

## Factors That Would Keep Sentiment Below 60.0

Several factors suggest consumer sentiment is likely to remain subdued in June:

- **Historical Inertia**: Consumer sentiment indicators typically move gradually rather than in large jumps, especially from such a low base.
- **Ongoing Economic Uncertainty**: Survey director Joanne Hsu noted that while consumers see the economy as "no worse than last month, they remained quite worried about the future".
- **Structural Headwinds**: Consumers continue to face high inflation expectations, debt pressures, and macroeconomic uncertainty.
- **Recent Trend Pattern**: The index has shown persistent weakness with no month in 2025 exceeding 57.0, suggesting strong downward pressures.

## Scenario for Exceeding 60.0

For the index to rise above 60.0 by the end of June, a significant positive shock or combination of shocks would likely be necessary:

- **Major Policy Intervention**: A significant new government stimulus program or dramatic shift in Federal Reserve policy (such as a surprise interest rate cut).
- **Inflation Breakthrough**: A sharp, unexpected drop in inflation or inflation expectations.
- **Labor Market Surge**: Unexpectedly robust job growth and wage increases that directly improve household finances.
- **Trade Policy Resolution**: A comprehensive resolution of trade tensions, going well beyond the temporary tariff pause.
- **Market Rally**: A sustained, strong stock market rally that significantly improves household wealth perceptions.

However, there is currently little evidence pointing to such transformative positive developments occurring within the next three weeks.

## Statistical Considerations

The magnitude of change required—a 15% increase in a single month from a near-record low—would be statistically unusual. Such dramatic shifts typically only occur during major economic turning points or in response to extraordinary events. The preliminary reading for June, to be released on June 13, 2025, will provide an important early indicator of whether any meaningful improvement is underway.

Given the current economic backdrop, persistent concerns about personal finances, and the substantial improvement needed to exceed the 60.0 threshold, a dramatic turnaround in consumer sentiment by the end of June appears highly improbable based on the weight of available evidence.
