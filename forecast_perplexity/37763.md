There are 16 days from today until the target date, and current observations indicate there are 13 crew members in space. Under normal operating conditions, with scheduled missions and known crew rotations continuing as planned, it is expected that the number will remain above 10. However, there remains a possibility that unexpected technical issues, operational disruptions, or sudden schedule changes could force an earlier-than-planned return of one or more crew members or delay new launches. Such disturbances, though atypical given the current trends and overlapping mission schedules, could potentially bring the count down to exactly 10 or even below that threshold.
