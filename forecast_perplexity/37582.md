Several indicators point to a steady but moderate year-over-year increase in rent for Birmingham, AL, as measured by the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for May 2025. On-the-ground rental data show the average monthly rent rose from $1,145 in May 2024 to $1,200 in May 2025, representing a 4.8% annual increase. This aligns with observed trends over the last year, where rent growth has remained positive but not rapid, typical of a "warm" rental market with steady demand and gradual pricing shifts.

National projections for rent growth in 2025 suggest increases around 3–4%, but Birmingham's local dynamics have produced slightly higher growth, though still behind overheated markets. The rental market remains affordable compared to national averages, with Birmingham rents significantly lower, indicating some latent demand but also a limit to rapid acceleration. Notably, local housing prices have dropped by 3.8% over the past year, reinforcing the expectation that rent growth is unlikely to surge far above the current trend.

Expert consensus generally anticipates ongoing, moderate growth, tempered by the possibility that increased multifamily construction—reflected in recent permitting data—could bring new supply online and cool the pace of increases. Conversely, risk factors exist on both sides: an oversupply of new units or local economic downturn could sharply limit rent growth or even turn it negative, while unexpected shocks such as a major influx of new residents, sudden economic expansion, or new regulatory constraints on supply could push growth higher than anticipated.

Recent month-over-month rent data show little additional increase, suggesting that while the annual figure is positive, the pace of growth may be leveling off as the rental market approaches equilibrium. This is further supported by the lack of significant recent home price appreciation.

Overall, the most reliable current data and contextual factors support a moderate year-over-year rent increase for Birmingham in May 2025, with the growth rate likely to remain near the recent 4.8% figure barring any major local shocks.
