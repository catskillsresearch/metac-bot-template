# AfD Ban Application Rationale: Will it happen before 2026?

The current political and legal environment surrounding the Alternative for Germany (AfD) features unprecedented pressure for a potential ban. In May 2025, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) officially designated the AfD as a "far-right extremist" party, the highest level of classification in Germany's system for assessing extremism. This classification represents a crucial prerequisite for any ban procedure and allows for extended surveillance measures, including wiretapping and deploying undercover informants.

## Current Status and Momentum

The political landscape has shifted dramatically following the BfV's designation. The AfD secured second place in Germany's federal elections in February 2025 with 20.8% of the vote, granting it the leadership of the opposition. Despite this electoral strength, several factors indicate growing momentum toward a potential ban:

- A cross-party group of Bundestag lawmakers has announced their intention to seek a ban and has met the threshold (at least 5% of parliament) required to bring the matter to a parliamentary vote
- Massive, coordinated public demonstrations have taken place across Germany, with tens of thousands demanding an immediate ban
- The legal foundation for a ban application is stronger than at any point in the AfD's history due to the BfV's official classification

## Obstacles and Counterforces

Despite this momentum, significant barriers to filing a ban application remain:

- Political caution at the highest levels of government persists, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz stating that the AfD "cannot be banned" and emphasizing addressing voter concerns that drive AfD support
- The AfD has filed a lawsuit against its classification as an extremist organization, arguing it is politically motivated
- The BfV has agreed not to publicly label the AfD as an extremist organization until the court case is resolved, potentially delaying or undermining ban efforts
- Historical precedent weighs heavily—twice in the past 25 years, the German government has tried to ban the ultranationalist National Democratic Party, but the Constitutional Court rejected these requests

## Procedural Considerations

For an application to ban a political party to be filed at the Federal Constitutional Court, it must come from one of three sources: the Federal Government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. While procedural progress has been made, the actual filing still requires a political breakthrough:

- The cross-party initiative has met the formal threshold to start a ban application (5% of Bundestag MPs)
- However, a successful parliamentary vote and subsequent filing at the Constitutional Court are still required
- Previous attempts have lapsed without a final vote due to political division and legislative discontinuity

## Timeline and Political Calculation

With approximately seven months remaining until January 1, 2026, the window for action is tight but not closed. The combination of the official extremist designation, demonstrated parliamentary interest, sustained public protests, and extensive civil society pressure suggests that the probability of an application being filed is higher than ever before.

However, key political figures—including both the current and former Chancellors—have expressed caution about the risks of a ban failing in the Federal Constitutional Court and the potential political backlash, which could further radicalize AfD supporters or even strengthen the party. With about 10 million voters supporting the AfD, there is legitimate concern that a ban attempt could be perceived as anti-democratic and backfire politically.

The AfD's strong electoral position as the second-largest party in the Bundestag makes the political stakes particularly high, and leaders remain wary of the risks of a failed ban attempt. The ongoing legal challenges by the AfD against its extremist classification add further uncertainty, as some leaders cite these disputes as a reason to delay action until courts rule definitively.

The probability that an application to ban the AfD will be filed at the Federal Constitutional Court before January 1, 2026, is above 50% but not overwhelming. While legal grounds and public pressure for a ban have never been stronger, the combination of political caution, legal complexity, and the tradition of institutional inertia in Germany means the status quo outcome—no ban application filed—remains a substantial possibility.
