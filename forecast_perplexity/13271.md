A substantial increase in lunar landing activity has occurred from 2022 through 2025, driven by both national space agencies and an expanding commercial sector. By late May 2025, five spacecraft had successfully landed and transmitted data from the lunar surface: India’s Chandrayaan-3, Japan’s SLIM, and three U.S. commercial landers (Intuitive Machines’ Odysseus and IM-2 Athena, and Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 1). Several additional missions are scheduled for the remainder of the year, including ispace’s Resilience, Astrobotic’s Griffin Mission 1, and Intuitive Machines’ IM-3, among others.

Historical data and recent experience underscore that lunar landings remain a formidable technical challenge, with recent commercial missions exhibiting success rates near 50%. While technical maturity and experience have improved over time, delays, partial successes, and outright failures remain common, especially among newer commercial operators and first-time national attempts. Nevertheless, NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program and similar initiatives globally have ensured a steady pipeline of planned launches.

Experts generally expect one or two additional successful landings beyond those already completed, but achieving perfect success across all scheduled missions is unlikely. However, if there are exceptional technical outcomes or accelerated launch timelines, the tally could rise higher, potentially including additional or unscheduled missions from established programs like China’s that have not been fully detailed in public sources. Conversely, systemic technical failures, funding shortfalls, or cascading delays could result in few or no further successes, freezing the count at current levels.

Given the mix of confirmed achievements, scheduled launches, and high historic risk, the most probable outcome is that the 2022–2025 period will see a total of six to seven successful spacecraft landings on the Moon, while rare scenarios could see as few as five or as many as eight or nine within this interval. This reflects consensus expectations amid high uncertainty in technical success rates and mission execution.
