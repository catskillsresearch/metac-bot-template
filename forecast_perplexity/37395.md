# Current Approval Trends for Sánchez and Erdoğan

As of late May 2025, Pedro Sánchez is showing positive momentum in his approval ratings. According to February 2025 polling data, his Socialist Party (PSOE) was the leading political force in Spain with 33.4% support, representing a significant 5.3-point increase from the previous month—the largest monthly gain in a year. While party support doesn't directly equate to personal approval ratings, it suggests a favorable trajectory for Sánchez.

Sánchez has maintained relatively stable approval since taking office, with his rating historically not falling below 42% since 2019. However, as of September 2024, over 45% of respondents reported having "no confidence" in him, while nearly 7% reported feeling "very confident" in his leadership.

For Erdoğan, specific recent approval numbers aren't provided in the available data, but there are several indications of persistent challenges to his popularity:

- He was mentioned alongside Sánchez in a February 2025 report as having "high disapproval rates"
- Turkey continues to face significant economic challenges, including inflation and currency problems
- He is pursuing controversial constitutional reforms that critics view as attempts to extend his power beyond 2028

## Recent Political Developments

Several key developments could influence both leaders' approval ratings before July 1:

**For Sánchez:**
- His strong stance on the Gaza conflict, including Spain's recognition of Palestine and criticism of Israel's military actions
- The continued upward trend in his party's polling numbers
- His involvement in EU-level discussions on various international issues
- Support for detained Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, which has created tension with Erdoğan

**For Erdoğan:**
- His constitutional reform initiative, which has appointed a team of 10 legal experts to draft a new constitution
- Public criticism of Sánchez for supporting İmamoğlu
- Statements ruling out early elections while emphasizing Turkey's stability
- Ongoing economic challenges that have historically depressed his approval ratings

## Key Factors That Could Shift Approval Before July

1. **Erdoğan's Constitutional Initiative**: Public perception of Erdoğan's constitutional reform efforts will significantly impact his approval. If widely viewed as a power grab to extend his rule, his approval could decline further.

2. **Gaza Conflict**: Sánchez's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza could either boost his popularity among those sympathetic to Palestine or create polarization in Spain.

3. **Diplomatic Tensions**: The ongoing diplomatic row between Spain and Turkey over Sánchez's support for İmamoğlu could affect both leaders' domestic standing.

4. **Economic Factors**: Turkey's persistent economic troubles continue to weigh on Erdoğan's popularity, while Spain's economic performance under Sánchez will similarly influence his approval.

5. **Potential Disruptive Events**: With just over a month until July 1, unexpected events—such as a political scandal, economic shock, or international crisis—could dramatically shift either leader's approval.

## Comparative Analysis

The evidence suggests a moderate advantage for Sánchez in this comparison:

1. His party has demonstrated recent positive momentum in polls
2. Erdoğan faces multiple challenges, including controversy over constitutional reforms and economic issues
3. Sánchez's strong stance on international issues like Gaza may resonate with his base
4. Approval ratings tend to change slowly absent dramatic events, favoring continuation of current trends

However, significant uncertainties remain:

1. Party support doesn't perfectly correlate with leader approval
2. The precise current approval percentages for direct comparison aren't available
3. Events in the next month could significantly shift either leader's standing

Absent major disruptive events, the most likely outcome is that Sánchez will maintain a modest lead over Erdoğan in approval ratings when measured on July 1, 2025.
