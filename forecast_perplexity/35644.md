The likelihood that any bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement established in 2025 between Russia and Ukraine will endure for an extended period is low, given the deeply entrenched obstacles and historical precedents. Both parties remain firmly polarized on core issues: Russia insists on recognition of its control over occupied territories, the indefinite postponement or abandonment of Ukrainian NATO membership, and the preservation of its strategic gains. Meanwhile, Ukraine demands full Russian withdrawal, robust security guarantees, and refuses to legitimize territorial losses. These positions remain fundamentally incompatible, and neither side has shown willingness to make the necessary concessions for a comprehensive settlement.

Recent diplomatic activity—including pressure from the US and proposals for limited truces such as a 30-day ceasefire—has generated episodes of optimism, but substantive breakthroughs remain elusive. Russia, in particular, continues to reject the idea of a ceasefire as a precondition for negotiations, preferring to maintain military pressure while bargaining. For its part, Ukraine and its Western partners prefer an initial cessation of hostilities as a trust-building measure, yet Russia remains skeptical, perceiving this as a tactical disadvantage and a risk that Ukraine could regroup. The result is a persistent deadlock on the sequencing of talks and conflict cessation.

Historical patterns in this and similar conflicts indicate that ceasefires are typically fragile and short-lived unless they are coupled with robust political settlements and enforcement mechanisms. Short truces in the 2022-2025 period have consistently collapsed due to violations, unresolved disputes, and lack of mutual trust. External actors—while highly engaged—have had limited success in bridging these divides, with international monitoring mechanisms and economic incentives providing only marginal increases in durability. While heavy international pressure, economic shocks, or unexpected political changes in either Russia or Ukraine could theoretically produce a longer-lasting agreement, such scenarios are improbable absent a major, unforeseen shock.

Thus, if a bilateral ceasefire or peace agreement does take effect in 2025, it is most likely to be short-lived—lasting less than 30 days or, at best, holding for a specific, negotiated period (such as the proposed 30 days) before lapsing. Any extension beyond this period would require significant convergence on core issues, durable international guarantees, and a level of mutual restraint not yet demonstrated by either side. Longer-term peace remains hostage to intractable disputes over sovereignty, territorial integrity, and future security arrangements, making durable cessation of hostilities in the current environment highly unlikely.
