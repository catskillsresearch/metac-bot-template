# Comprehensive Analysis: Bird Flu Impact on US Farmed Birds in 2025

The question of how many farmed birds will be killed in the United States due to bird flu in 2025 requires careful analysis of current trends, historical patterns, and potential future developments.

## Current Situation Assessment

As of May 2025, approximately 20-25 million birds have already been culled due to H5N1 outbreaks in the first five months of the year. January 2025 was particularly severe, with 18.8 million commercial egg layers affected and a total of 23 million birds euthanized that month alone. This follows significant outbreaks in late 2024, including approximately 18 million birds culled in December 2024.

The H5N1 virus has spread extensively, with the CDC reporting 70 human cases across 13 states as of April 2025, including one death in Louisiana in January. Additionally, the USDA has reported that 989 dairy herds in 17 states have confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows as of March 2025, with the number of affected herds continuing to grow.

## Trend Analysis and Projections

If the current pace of culling continues linearly for the remainder of 2025, we could expect a year-end total of approximately 40-45 million birds. However, avian flu outbreaks typically exhibit seasonality, with peaks occurring in colder months (late fall and winter). This suggests the possibility of a summer slowdown followed by a potential resurgence in late 2025.

The USDA has forecasted egg prices to surge 41% in 2025 amid the ongoing avian flu outbreak, indicating expectations of continued significant impact on poultry populations throughout the year.

## Key Risk Factors

Several factors could significantly influence the final outcome:

- **Virus Mutations**: If H5N1 mutates to become more transmissible among birds or develops resistance to current control measures, we could see widespread outbreaks affecting substantially more commercial operations.

- **Staff Shortages**: The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has lost 16% of its staff, including 400 veterinarians, which could hamper response times and effectiveness, potentially allowing outbreaks to spread further before containment.

- **Cross-Species Transmission**: The virus has already spread to dairy cows, creating additional reservoirs that could reintroduce the virus to poultry populations.

- **Wild Bird Migration**: Seasonal migration patterns in fall 2025 could introduce new viral strains or increase transmission to commercial flocks.

## Potential Mitigating Factors

Several developments could help reduce the overall impact:

- **Biosecurity Improvements**: Enhanced biosecurity measures at commercial operations could limit the spread of the virus.

- **Vaccination Programs**: Development and deployment of effective vaccines could reduce the need for mass culling.

- **Seasonal Effects**: Warmer summer temperatures might naturally slow viral transmission.

- **Government Intervention**: The federal government has allocated significant resources to fighting bird flu, including funds for biosecurity and vaccine research.

## Possible Scenarios

**Low-End Scenario (15-25 million birds)**: If containment efforts prove highly effective, warm summer weather reduces transmission, and no major new outbreaks occur after early spring, the total could end near current levels.

**Mid-Range Scenario (25-40 million birds)**: If current trends continue but with some moderation, and if seasonal effects follow historical patterns with reduced summer spread followed by a moderate fall/winter resurgence.

**High-End Scenario (40-60+ million birds)**: If a new, highly transmissible strain emerges, perhaps facilitated by circulation in dairy cattle or wild birds, or if resource constraints delay rapid depopulation and containment, we could see totals approaching or exceeding 50 million birds.

The most likely scenario appears to be a year-end total in the range of 30-40 million birds, representing a substantial impact but potentially falling short of the massive 2022 peak, assuming some effectiveness in containment measures and no catastrophic breakdowns in the response system.
