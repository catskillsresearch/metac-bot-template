# Comprehensive Analysis: US or California AI Model Licensing Requirements by 2026

As of May 26, 2025, approximately 7 months remain until the resolution date of December 31, 2025. The current regulatory landscape shows neither the US federal government nor California requires a license or permit to train large AI models. Understanding whether this will change before 2026 requires examining existing legislation, implementation timelines, and regulatory trends.

## Current Regulatory Environment

### California's AI Legislation

California has emerged as a leader in AI regulation, with several significant laws recently passed:

- **California AI Transparency Act**: Requires providers of generative AI systems with over 1 million monthly users to implement watermarking and disclosure mechanisms. This law focuses on transparency rather than licensing and takes effect January 1, 2026—after the resolution window.

- **AB 2013**: Mandates that developers publicly post information about data used to train generative AI systems, including for systems modified or released after January 1, 2022. However, this is a transparency requirement, not a licensing regime, and becomes effective January 1, 2026.

- **AB 412 (pending)**: Would require developers to document and disclose to copyright holders what materials were used in training before a generative AI system is publicly available. Again, this represents a documentation and information-sharing approach rather than a licensing requirement.

The California Frontier AI Working Group, established by Governor Newsom in September 2024, released a draft report on March 18, 2025, that assesses transparency requirements as a "necessary foundation" for AI regulation. The report recommends transparency in five categories: training data acquisition, developer safety practices, security practices, pre-deployment testing, and downstream impacts. Notably, it does not recommend a licensing regime.

### Federal Landscape

At the federal level, no laws or regulations currently mandate a license or permit to train large AI models. Federal action has primarily focused on executive orders, guidelines, agency reports, and discussions about copyright-related issues, rather than creating a formal licensing system for AI model training.

## Key Distinctions in Regulatory Approaches

It's important to differentiate between two distinct regulatory approaches:

1. **Transparency/disclosure requirements**: Mandate after-the-fact documentation, posting, or notification, but do not condition or restrict the act of model training on receiving government approval in advance. This is the current approach in both California and at the federal level.

2. **Licensing/permitting requirements**: Would necessitate government approval prior to conducting a large AI training run—a significantly more restrictive approach that is not currently being implemented.

## Legislative Trajectory and Implementation Timeline

Several factors make a licensing requirement unlikely to materialize before 2026:

- The most significant California AI laws (including the AI Transparency Act and AB 2013) take effect January 1, 2026—just after the resolution date for this forecast.

- Legislative processes for novel technology licensing regimes typically involve prolonged stakeholder input, drafting periods, and implementation phases. With only 7 months remaining in 2025, there is limited time for a new licensing regime to be proposed, passed, and implemented.

- The clear regulatory direction in both California and at the federal level has been toward transparency, disclosure, and documentation requirements rather than licensing or permitting regimes that would restrict or grant permission to train large AI models.

## Status Quo Analysis

The status quo strongly indicates a "no licensing requirement" outcome, with robust evidence that California and the US have chosen disclosure and transparency (not license-based gatekeeping) as their core AI regulatory approach for model training. All currently enacted or soon-to-be-enacted laws require disclosure and reporting, not licensing.

While figures like Sam Altman have publicly called for licensing, actual policymaking has not yet embraced this approach. California has moved faster than most states on transparency and copyright-related regulations but has not implemented a licensing regime.

## Industry and Implementation Considerations

For AI developers, the current and upcoming regulatory environment will mean:
- Increasing documentation and disclosure requirements about training data
- Greater transparency around the use of copyrighted materials
- Watermarking and identification of AI-generated content

However, these requirements do not constitute a government licensing or permitting system that would restrict who can train large AI models or require pre-approval for training runs.

## Conclusion

Given the legislative calendars, the effective dates of relevant laws (mostly January 1, 2026), and the clear focus on transparency/disclosure rather than government licensing or permitting, it appears highly unlikely that either the US or California will require licenses to train large AI models before 2026. The regulatory trajectory is established toward transparency requirements rather than licensing, and there is insufficient time remaining in 2025 for such a significant regulatory shift to be both enacted and implemented.

Barring an unforeseen regulatory emergency or unprecedented legislative acceleration, the overwhelming likelihood is that no licensing requirement for large AI model training will be in place in either California or at the federal level before December 31, 2025.
