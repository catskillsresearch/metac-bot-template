Over the next decade, the trajectory of affirmative action in public employment across US states will be influenced by a convergence of legal, political, and societal factors.

Currently, nine states—including California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Idaho, and Arizona—have explicit bans on affirmative action in some form, with most of these enacted over several decades through ballot initiatives, legislation, or executive action. The Supreme Court’s 2023 decision prohibiting race-based affirmative action in higher education admissions established a significant legal precedent, though it does not directly extend to public employment. However, the possibility remains that the Court may broaden its ruling to make affirmative action in public employment unconstitutional, which would result in a nationwide ban without individual state legislation.

Recent years have seen increasing momentum against Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives at both state and federal levels. For example, in 2024 Iowa enacted legislation (SF 2435) banning DEI offices at state universities, and Indiana’s governor signed an executive order in 2025 prohibiting state funds for DEI programs in government agencies. Simultaneously, President Trump’s executive order in January 2025 eliminated the requirement for federal contractors to maintain affirmative action programs, signaling a shift in federal policy that could encourage additional states to pursue similar bans.

Several pathways could lead to over half of US states (at least 26) forbidding affirmative action in public employment by 2035:

- **Judicial expansion:** The Supreme Court could rule that affirmative action in public employment is unconstitutional, leading to an immediate and nationwide effect.
- **State legislative momentum:** Republican-controlled state legislatures, buoyed by federal policy trends and growing anti-DEI sentiment, may pass additional bans through legislation or ballot initiatives, especially in states where public opinion is skeptical of race-based preferences.
- **Public opinion and political climate:** Data shows that a significant portion of the public opposes using race in college admissions—a proxy for broader attitudes toward affirmative action. This could bolster efforts to pass bans, particularly through voter-driven ballot initiatives.

Nevertheless, several countervailing forces could impede a sweeping shift:

- **Political resistance and state autonomy:** Democratic-controlled states and those with strong progressive constituencies are likely to resist bans and could even challenge the legality or implementation of such policies.
- **Legal complexities:** The distinction between affirmative action in education and public employment introduces legal hurdles, as public employment is governed by different statutes and precedents.
- **Implementation and enforcement challenges:** Even when bans are enacted, enforcement and scope can differ, and legal challenges at the state level may slow or reverse progress toward additional bans.

Overall, while only nine states have enacted bans over multiple decades, the pace is likely to accelerate due to recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, federal executive actions, and growing state-level anti-DEI initiatives. The most decisive shift would occur if the Supreme Court directly addresses and bans affirmative action in public employment. 

If such a judicial path is not taken, the combination of legislative momentum in conservative states, public opinion trends, and ongoing federal influence makes it plausible that over half of US states will enact bans by 2035, though substantial resistance is expected in more progressive or politically mixed states. The interplay between federal actions, Supreme Court decisions, state legislative trends, and public sentiment will ultimately determine whether this threshold is reached.
