# When Will Humanity's Descendants Meet Grabby Aliens?

The question of when humanity's descendants might encounter "grabby aliens" requires an analysis of the model developed by Robin Hanson and colleagues, which currently represents the most detailed quantitative forecast available on this topic.

## Understanding Grabby Aliens

Grabby aliens, as defined in the model, are civilizations that expand rapidly through space, visibly transforming the environments they control. These would be Type II or higher Kardashev civilizations (utilizing ≥10²⁶ W of energy) that actively spread throughout the cosmos at significant fractions of light speed.

## Timeline Predictions

Based on the central parameter estimates in Hanson's model, humanity's descendants are most likely to encounter grabby aliens approximately 100 million years from now. The confidence interval spans from roughly 10 million years (10th percentile) to about 1 billion years (90th percentile).

## Key Model Parameters

The Hanson et al. model relies on three critical parameters, each estimated to be known within approximately a factor of four:

1. The expansion speed of grabby civilizations
2. The appearance rate of grabby civilizations
3. The time required for a civilization to become grabby after its origin

## Evidence Supporting the Model

Several key observations constrain these predictions:

- We currently see no evidence of grabby alien civilizations in our sky (no visible reorganization of stars or galaxies)
- Humans have appeared relatively early in cosmic history according to the hard-steps model
- If grabby civilizations exist, they would expand and visibly change the volumes they control

The model suggests that if humanity's descendants become grabby themselves, we would be born relatively close to the typical origin date of such civilizations due to selection effects. This helps explain our apparent "early" emergence in cosmic history.

## Scenarios for Earlier Contact

A significantly earlier encounter (within a few million years) would require:

- A nearby grabby civilization already expanding in our immediate cosmic neighborhood
- The civilization being currently undetected despite its "loud" nature
- Approaching at relativistic speed
- Our own civilization rapidly accelerating its expansion capabilities

Given our current observational capabilities and the nature of grabby aliens (who would reengineer entire star systems), this scenario is considered highly unlikely.

## Scenarios for Delayed or No Contact

The encounter could be significantly delayed or never occur if:

- Humanity goes extinct before any contact occurs
- Grabby civilizations are far rarer than the model predicts
- Physical limitations to expansion exist that the model doesn't account for
- Technological or physical barriers prevent the spread of civilizations
- The hard-steps model significantly underestimates the difficulty of becoming a space-faring civilization

## Model Limitations

Some scientists have criticized aspects of the grabby aliens theory. David Kipping argues that the theory's reliance on aliens expanding at speeds close to light speed makes it unfalsifiable and proposes alternative explanations for our apparent early emergence.

Additionally, the model doesn't fully account for potential constraints on intergalactic travel. With sub-light-speed travel, the physically accessible universe might be largely confined to the local group (our Galaxy, M31, and some minor irregulars).

The model suggests that approximately 1 in 1000 intelligent civilizations eventually becomes space-faring and expansionist, but this parameter has substantial uncertainty.

## Conclusion

The grabby aliens model provides a framework for understanding when humanity's descendants might encounter extraterrestrial civilizations. While the median estimate is approximately 100 million years, there remains significant uncertainty in both directions due to parameter uncertainty and model assumptions.
