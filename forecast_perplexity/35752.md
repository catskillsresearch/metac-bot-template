The likelihood of a new Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) member being appointed before any current member’s term ends and before January 20, 2029, is primarily shaped by the following factors:

- The standard structure of the FOMC is highly stable, with seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (BOG) serving staggered 14-year terms and rotating regional Reserve Bank presidents making up the rest of the voting members. As of May 2025, all Board seats are filled, and no public indications exist of imminent resignations, removals, or plans for statutory changes or expansion of the Committee.

- Historically, early departures from the Board due to resignations or removals are possible but occur with low frequency. Over a typical four-year window, the chance of unscheduled exits is under 20%. Most changes are due to regular term expirations or normal rotations. Early departures are usually driven by personal, health, or professional reasons, rather than political intervention.

- Political pressure can surface, especially in periods of strained relations between the White House and the Fed. While recent years have included public criticism of FOMC leadership—such as President Trump’s comments about Chair Powell—there is no evidence of concrete steps toward removal. Legally, removal of a BOG member requires cause, typically interpreted as misconduct, not mere disagreement over policy. The President’s public withdrawal of threats to fire Powell and the rigid statutory framework reinforce the difficulty of midterm removals.

- The main uncertainties are inherently unpredictable personal events, such as health crises or scandals, which could prompt a Governor’s early exit. However, there are currently no public signals or credible rumors suggesting such developments among existing FOMC members.

- The process for appointing a replacement is time-consuming and requires Senate confirmation, which introduces additional procedural barriers and reduces the likelihood of rapid changes, even if a seat did become unexpectedly vacant.

- Expansion of the Board, or the addition of FOMC seats through legislative or executive action, is extremely unlikely unless driven by significant political consensus or crisis. No current legislative initiatives suggest such changes are imminent.

- Rotations among regional Reserve Bank presidents continue to occur on a fixed schedule and do not constitute extraordinary appointments under the terms of this forecast.

Consequently, the most probable scenario is that the FOMC’s composition will change only through ordinary succession and scheduled term completions. The chance of a new member being appointed before any existing member’s term ends—due to resignation, removal, or statutory change—remains low, primarily constrained by historical precedent, institutional inertia, clear legal barriers, and the absence of current public signals pointing toward early vacancies or expansion. Nonetheless, there remains a nonzero risk, due solely to the unpredictable nature of personal and professional decisions over a multi-year outlook.
