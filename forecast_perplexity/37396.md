# River Great Ouse Water Level Forecast: Welney Causeway on July 1, 2025

The water level forecast for the River Great Ouse at Welney Causeway requires careful analysis of current conditions, seasonal patterns, and broader water management contexts across East Anglia and the UK.

## Current Conditions

As of May 29, 2025, the River Great Ouse at Welney Causeway has a water level of 0.69m, which falls within the normal range (0.459m to 2.40m) but is positioned in the lower portion, creating only a 0.23m buffer above the "low" threshold. The current trend is described as "steady" with no immediate indication of rapid change.

The monitoring station's historical data provides important reference points:
- Normal range: 0.459m (lower threshold) to 2.40m (upper threshold)
- Historical minimum: 0.303m
- Historical maximum: 4.134m
- Flooding threshold: 2.35m (low-lying land flooding possible above this level)

## Regional Water Context

The broader water situation across the UK shows concerning trends toward water scarcity. Almost all of the UK is experiencing below normal or low river levels, with only southwestern England and southern Wales as exceptions. This widespread pattern of lower-than-usual river levels suggests a regional drought condition affecting East Anglia.

The UK government has taken significant action by fast-tracking new reservoir projects in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, designating them as "nationally significant" to address long-term water supply issues. Water Minister Emma Hardy has issued warnings that without intervention, England could "run out of drinking water by the mid-2030s," highlighting the severity of water management challenges in the region.

## Seasonal Patterns and Climate Factors

The Ouse Washes area exhibits distinct seasonal variations throughout the year. Winter months typically see the area transform into "an inland sea" stretching for miles, while summer months present "lush green water meadows and drains." July 1st falls firmly in the summer season, when water levels are historically lower than in winter and spring.

Climate change impacts are recognized as a key threat to the Great Ouse Fens area, with projections indicating mean sea level could rise between 0.21m and 0.34m by 2050. However, this longer-term trend is unlikely to significantly impact river levels within the 33-day forecast timeframe.

## Forward-Looking Analysis

Several factors suggest downward pressure on water levels by July 1st:

1. Seasonal patterns indicate drier conditions in early July compared to spring months, naturally leading to lower river levels.

2. The widespread UK water supply concerns suggest a broader trend of low water levels that may persist into July.

3. The current level's proximity to the lower threshold (only 0.23m buffer) could be eliminated with continued dry conditions typical of early summer.

Countervailing factors to consider:

1. The current "steady" designation suggests gradual rather than rapid change.

2. Water management practices, including controlled releases from upstream reservoirs or sluice gates, could artificially maintain certain water levels within the Ouse Washes system.

3. While unlikely given current trends, unexpected rainfall events in June could temporarily stabilize or increase water levels.

## Water Level Probability Assessment

Given the analyzed factors, the most likely outcome for July 1, 2025 is a water level in the "low" category (below 0.459m), with a significant but lesser chance of maintaining "normal" levels, and only a minimal possibility of reaching "high" status.

The current level's proximity to the lower threshold, combined with typical seasonal patterns suggesting continued decrease into summer months and the broader UK trend showing water scarcity, all point toward the river level potentially falling below the normal range by July 1st. The relatively small buffer of 0.23m above the "low" classification could be eliminated with continued dry conditions typical of early summer.

However, the status quo bias and water management practices in the Ouse Washes system provide some counterbalance, suggesting a substantial possibility that normal levels could be maintained if precipitation remains adequate or if artificial management interventions occur.

A high water level outcome would require exceptional circumstances such as unexpected heavy rainfall events that could rapidly increase river levels, which seems highly improbable given current conditions and seasonal patterns for early July.
