Robert Caro, acclaimed for his meticulous and immersive research, has made significant progress on the fifth and final volume of *The Years of Lyndon Johnson*, with about 980 manuscript pages completed as of early 2025. However, the scope of unfinished work remains substantial. Key sections, particularly those covering the Vietnam War, Medicare, Medicaid, and aspects of the civil rights movement, are still incomplete. Caro himself has acknowledged that the manuscript will be "very, very long" and will require substantial further work and editing.

Caro’s working method is defined by an uncompromising perfectionism and a deep commitment to exhaustive primary research—including, in this case, a still-unmade research trip to Vietnam, which he regards as essential to his narrative. This approach, while resulting in works of historic depth and literary acclaim, has contributed to increasingly lengthy intervals between volumes, with each previous book taking roughly 8–12 years to complete. Thirteen years have now passed since the publication of the fourth volume in 2012.

At 89 years old, Caro faces significant actuarial risks. While there are no public reports of major health decline, statistical life expectancy for men his age implies a rising annual risk of mortality or reduced working capacity. This reality shortens the practical window left for him to both finish the manuscript and see it through the lengthy publication process, which itself can add many months between completion and public availability.

Caro has publicly stated he will not permit another writer to finish his work, ensuring that only what he himself completes will be published. If he dies before finishing, he has pledged to release whatever is done, but not as a completed, fully authored final volume. This determination makes the process more personal but also limits the chances of a timely publication in the event of a health setback.

The status quo is therefore one of slow yet steady progress, substantial work remaining, and formidable time pressures imposed by age and health. Unless Caro experiences a dramatic and unlikely acceleration in his writing or alters his standards for completion, the possibilities for a significant change in trajectory seem minimal. Even with continued health, the necessary research, writing, editing, and production could push the timeline well beyond what actuarial data suggests is likely for someone of his age.

In summary, while Caro’s dedication and continued progress leave a nonzero chance that the final volume could be published during his lifetime, the preponderance of evidence—his age, the extent of remaining work, the time-consuming nature of his process, and publishing logistics—suggests that the most probable outcome is that the book will not become available for order while Caro is still alive.
