The time until the outcome is known is approximately 6 years and 6 months, as the outcome will be determined in 2031. Currently, the fertility rate stands at 1.51 children per woman, based on 2023 data. If the current trend of modest fluctuations between 1.2 and 1.5 children per woman continues, the fertility rate is likely to remain around 1.50 children per woman by 2031. Experts and markets, taking into account historical data and recent policy measures, generally expect Hungary's fertility rate to stay within the range of 1.4 to 1.6 children per woman, with a median estimate of 1.50 children per woman.

Unexpected scenarios could significantly alter these projections. A major economic downturn or political instability could lead to increased uncertainty and financial insecurity, discouraging family formation and potentially resulting in a fertility rate below 1.3 children per woman. Conversely, a breakthrough in pronatalist policies, such as highly effective financial incentives or cultural shifts towards larger families, could push the fertility rate above 1.7 children per woman.
