The current data and trends suggest that Ukraine's exports in 2025 are unlikely to exceed the $81.53 billion level reached in 2021. Ukraine faces significant challenges in its core export sectors, such as grains and metals, primarily due to ongoing war-related disruptions and global market competition. The expiration of favorable trade agreements further complicates the situation, as does the high trade deficit and domestic policy issues. These factors collectively hinder Ukraine's ability to reach its 2021 export levels.

While there is a scenario where a rapid and unexpected resolution to the conflict could lead to a stabilization of Ukraine's economy, this would require substantial changes in the geopolitical and economic landscape. Such a resolution could potentially boost Ukraine's economic activity and export capacity, especially if coupled with improved global market conditions, increased demand, and higher prices for key export commodities. Additionally, new trade agreements or extensions of existing ones could provide Ukraine with competitive advantages in international markets.

However, these positive scenarios are less likely given the current geopolitical and economic environment. The ongoing war, expiration of trade preferences, and challenges in key export sectors remain significant obstacles. Although there is some growth in sectors like IT services, it is unlikely to offset the declines in larger export categories. Therefore, the status quo outcome of Ukraine's exports not surpassing the 2021 level by the end of 2025 is the most probable scenario.
