# 45V Hydrogen Tax Credit Repeal: What Happens Next

## Current Legislative Status

The House of Representatives has passed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill" by an extremely narrow margin of 215-214 along party lines. This Republican-backed legislation would terminate the Section 45V hydrogen tax credit for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, effectively bringing forward the sunset date by approximately seven years from its original timeline. 

The bill has now moved to the Senate for further debate and potential passage. If enacted in its current form, hydrogen projects would no longer be able to claim the valuable 45V credits (worth up to $3/kg of hydrogen) if they enter construction after the end of 2025, significantly curtailing what was originally set to run until 2033.

## Political and Economic Dynamics

The push to sunset the 45V credit is part of a broader Republican effort to roll back climate-focused provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith characterized the legislation as "the key to making America great again," claiming it was "drafted by the American people" rather than special interests.

However, the extremely narrow House passage suggests limited room for maneuver in the Senate, where the dynamics may be even more challenging for the bill's proponents. The Senate typically requires broader consensus to advance legislation, particularly on matters affecting economic development and energy policy.

The 45V tax credit has been credited with catalyzing momentum in the US hydrogen sector since the IRA was passed in August 2022. Earlier this year, over 110 trade groups and companies, including both traditional energy interests and renewable energy advocates, sent a letter to lawmakers warning that "private sector investment is at risk due to the uncertainty around this crucial incentive." They cautioned that without the 45V credit, "hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs" in the hydrogen sector could be lost to other countries.

## Safe Harbor Considerations

The current House bill does not appear to include a safe harbor provision for ongoing hydrogen projects. This is notable since such provisions are common in tax credit modifications, allowing projects already in development to proceed under the original rules. The absence of a safe harbor provision makes the legislation particularly disruptive to the hydrogen market.

As the bill progresses through the Senate, there's a significant possibility that a safe harbor provision could be added. Tax credits that affect major infrastructure investments often include grandfathering clauses to protect investments already committed or underway. The final legislation, if passed, may well include such protections as a compromise measure to reduce economic disruption.

Historically, when tax credits are repealed or modified, Congress often includes grandfathering provisions to protect investments already made or committed. This approach reduces economic disruption and legal challenges from affected parties.

## Possible Outcomes

Several outcomes remain possible as the legislation moves through the Senate:

1. **2025-2026 sunset without safe harbor:** This outcome aligns with the current House-passed legislation. The absence of safe harbor provisions in the current bill suggests this could be the administration's preferred approach, creating a clean break from the previous policy.

2. **2025-2026 sunset with safe harbor:** Industry pressure could lead to the addition of safe harbor provisions to protect investments already underway. Historical precedent with tax credit phase-outs often includes such protections, making this a plausible compromise outcome that might garner broader support in the Senate.

3. **Later sunset dates:** While less likely given current momentum, longer phase-out periods (2027-2031) cannot be entirely ruled out as potential compromise positions during Senate negotiations.

4. **No change before 2026:** Given the narrow margin in the House vote and potential resistance in the Senate, there remains a possibility that the bill could stall or fail to pass before January 1, 2026, resulting in no immediate changes to the 45V credit timeline.

## Senate Considerations

The Senate now takes up the bill with several important factors that could influence the outcome:

- The Senate is likely to face strong lobbying from the hydrogen industry and affected states to include a safe harbor for projects that have made significant investments but haven't yet started construction.

- Senate dynamics typically favor more moderate approaches that include transition provisions, which increases the likelihood of modifications to the House bill.

- A compromise version could emerge where, instead of outright repeal, Congress makes the credit less generous or narrows eligibility while including safe harbor provisions.

- Time constraints and competing legislative priorities could impact whether the bill receives full consideration before the deadline.

## Conclusion

Given the strong industry response, Senate dynamics, and historical precedents with tax credit phase-outs, the most likely outcome is a 2025-2026 sunset with safe harbor provisions. This balances several key considerations: the political momentum to roll back IRA provisions, industry pressure for transition protection, economic considerations around disruption, and the realities of the legislative process.

However, the 2025-2026 sunset without safe harbor remains a strong possibility if partisan discipline holds and the bill moves quickly through the Senate without substantial modification. The chance of no sunset reduction before 2026 persists due to possible Senate inaction, procedural delays, or negotiation breakdowns, while later sunsets are now less likely given the clear focus on the 2025 cutoff date.
