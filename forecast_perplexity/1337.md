The formation rate of suitable stars is best understood as centering near 0.8 to 1.0 stars per year under current conditions. This baseline is supported by a convergence of expert opinion and observational trends, which indicate that—with no significant external disruptions—the processes governing star formation remain relatively stable over the coming century. Stellar population models and ongoing observations of star‐forming regions suggest that, if conditions remain unchanged, the rate will adhere to this approximate value.

At the same time, there is recognition of meaningful uncertainty. For instance, improvements in how “suitability” is defined—for example, restricting the criteria narrowly to certain types of stars or conversely broadening it to include additional stable types—could shift the effective rate. On one hand, if revised criteria or unforeseen galactic feedback effects reduce the number of stars that qualify, the effective rate could drop toward about 0.5 stars per year. On the other hand, if emerging evidence shows that more newly formed stars meet the criteria, or if transient phenomena like minor mergers or gas influxes temporarily boost star formation, the rate might rise, suggesting values in the vicinity of 1.1 or even up to around 1.5 stars per year in the most extreme scenarios.

Overall, the prevailing balance between the status quo and these potential deviations supports the view that while the central estimate remains around 0.8 to 1.0 stars per year, there is a reasonable possibility for adjustment by roughly ±0.3–0.5 stars per year, reflecting both improved understanding and the dynamic nature of galactic evolution.
