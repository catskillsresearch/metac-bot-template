# H5 Bird Flu in the United States: Current Status and Future Trajectory

As of mid-April 2025, the CDC has reported 71 confirmed human cases of H5 bird flu in the United States for 2024 and 2025 combined. This represents a significant increase from earlier periods, with case counts rising from 27 in October 2024 to 66 by January 2025. However, the rate of new infections has slowed considerably in recent months, with only a few additional cases identified since January.

## Current Situation Assessment

The vast majority of human H5 bird flu cases have been linked to direct animal exposure. Most infections involved unprotected workplace exposures, particularly among individuals who had contact with infected dairy cows or poultry without using recommended personal protective equipment. A small number of cases involved exposure to backyard poultry, and for three cases, the source of exposure could not be determined.

The first death from H5 bird flu in the United States was reported in January 2025, marking a tragic but not unexpected development given the known severity potential of the virus. Outside the United States, approximately half of the 950+ reported H5N1 bird flu cases have resulted in death.

## Projected Outcomes

If the current slowing trend continues, we might expect approximately 1 new case per month through the end of 2025, adding 6-7 more cases to the current total. This would result in approximately 77-78 total cases by year-end.

The virus has demonstrated concerning adaptability, affecting multiple mammalian species and spreading in new patterns. The genetic analysis indicates that different genotypes are circulating, with the Louisiana severe case involving the D1.1 genotype related to viruses detected in wild birds and poultry, while earlier human cases were linked to the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows.

## Risk Factors and Uncertainties

Several factors could influence the final case count:

**Biosecurity Measures**: Enhanced biosecurity protocols at agricultural facilities, improved protective equipment usage, and effective surveillance could significantly limit new cases. If these measures prove highly effective, the final count might barely exceed the current 71 cases.

**Viral Mutation**: The most concerning risk factor is potential viral mutation. If H5N1 evolves to enable efficient human-to-human transmission, case numbers could increase dramatically. The virus has shown increased adaptation to mammals, with mammal outbreaks doubling in 2024 compared to 2023, and experts warn that even a single amino acid change could potentially enable human-to-human spread.

**Animal Reservoirs**: Continued circulation in animal populations, particularly in dairy cattle and poultry, creates ongoing opportunities for spillover to humans. New animal reservoirs or spread to regions with intensive agriculture could increase human exposure.

## Public Health Perspective

The CDC maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, emphasizing that no person-to-person transmission has been identified. However, the agency continues to monitor the situation closely, conducting surveillance and recommending protective measures for those with occupational exposure risks.

Healthcare providers are advised to remain alert to the possibility of human infections with novel influenza A viruses, particularly in patients with relevant exposure history. This vigilance will be especially important during summer months when seasonal influenza is typically at low levels, making unusual influenza cases more noticeable.

While current evidence suggests continued slow accumulation of cases rather than explosive growth, the unpredictable nature of viral evolution warrants ongoing caution and preparedness for potential shifts in transmission patterns.
