The prospect of constructing a space elevator on Earth by 2100 faces significant challenges, primarily due to technical, financial, and political barriers. As of 2025, the absence of a material with the necessary tensile strength and low density remains a critical obstacle. Despite ongoing research, no viable solution has emerged, and the rapid advancements in reusable rocket technology continue to provide a more immediate and economically viable alternative for space access. This diminishes the urgency and economic incentive to invest in a space elevator.

The status quo suggests a "No" outcome, as the current trajectory lacks the momentum needed to overcome these substantial hurdles. Political and financial support is largely directed towards other space exploration initiatives, and without a major shift in global priorities or a breakthrough in materials science, the concept of a space elevator remains theoretical.

However, a scenario leading to a "Yes" outcome would require a significant breakthrough in materials science, resulting in the development of a suitable material for the elevator's construction. This would need to be coupled with a shift in global policy and economic priorities towards sustainable and cost-effective space infrastructure. Such a shift could foster international collaboration and investment, potentially adopting a multi-stage approach to reduce technological barriers incrementally. The successful construction and operation of a space elevator on the Moon or Mars could serve as a proof of concept, further accelerating efforts to build one on Earth.

Overall, while there is potential for breakthroughs and shifts in policy, the historical pace of technological and policy change suggests that these developments are unlikely to occur rapidly enough to meet the 2100 deadline. The challenges associated with a space elevator are substantial, and without significant changes from the current trajectory, the probability of its realization remains low.
