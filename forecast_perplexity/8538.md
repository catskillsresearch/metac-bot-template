Over the next 25 years until 2050, significant shifts in technology, policy, and consumer behavior are set to transform the US light‐duty vehicle market. If current conditions persist—with modest improvements in battery technology and incremental policy support—the market could stabilize with electric vehicles accounting for roughly one‐quarter of new car sales. However, if ongoing trends see steady enhancements in technology, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks, the share is likely to grow toward around 40%. This middle‐ground scenario aligns with many expert views that generally anticipate electric vehicles capturing between 30% and 50% of the market by mid-century.

At the same time, there are clear pathways to both lower and higher outcomes. On the downside, should progress in battery cost reductions stall, or if supply chain bottlenecks, insufficient policy incentives, and tepid consumer adoption come into play, the electric vehicle share could slip to levels as low as 15–20%. Conversely, if breakthroughs in battery technology emerge rapidly, accompanied by strong governmental policies and a robust expansion of charging networks, consumer uptake could accelerate dramatically—potentially driving market shares to 70% or more.

In sum, the evolution of the US auto market hinges on the interplay among technological innovation, policy direction, and market dynamics. While a moderate scenario settling around a 40% share appears plausible, the final outcome will depend on how these factors converge over the coming decades.
