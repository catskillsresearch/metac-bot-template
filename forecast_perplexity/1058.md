The likelihood of humanity running out of at least one element considered "under serious threat" by 2040 is influenced by several factors. Historically, markets have demonstrated a strong ability to adapt to supply risks through mechanisms such as increased recycling, substitution, and the discovery and exploitation of new sources. These adaptations have typically mitigated long-term shortages and prevented significant price spikes.

Advancements in recycling technologies and increased efficiency in the use of these elements are expected to continue, reducing demand pressure. Additionally, ongoing exploration and mining of alternative sources, along with successful policy interventions, are likely to ensure that supply meets demand. Technological innovations may also reduce reliance on these critical elements, further stabilizing the market.

However, the potential for significant external shocks introduces some uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, or natural disasters could disrupt supply chains, leading to shortages. Moreover, rapid technological advancements or policy changes that dramatically increase demand for specific elements could outpace the market's ability to adapt quickly, resulting in sustained price spikes.

While the probability of a sustained 10x inflation-adjusted price increase remains low due to the market's historical resilience and ongoing efforts to secure critical mineral supplies, the possibility of unforeseen geopolitical or technological disruptions cannot be entirely dismissed. Given the current trends and the time frame until 2040, the probability of running out of any of these elements is considered low to moderate.
