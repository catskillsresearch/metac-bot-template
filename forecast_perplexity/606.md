The possibility of detecting a message from Luyten’s Star before 2046 is subject to a series of stringent physical, astronomical, and technological constraints. Luyten’s Star (GJ 273) is approximately 12.3 light-years away and hosts at least one confirmed exoplanet in its habitable zone, GJ 273b, a super-Earth with a mass of about 2.89 times that of Earth. In 2017, humanity sent a targeted radio message toward this system, which will reach its destination around 2030. If technologically capable intelligent life exists there, interprets the message promptly, and responds immediately, the earliest reply could arrive at Earth around 2042, creating a narrow four-year window for potential detection before the 2045 deadline.

However, this positive scenario relies on a highly improbable series of events:

- There must be intelligent life in the Luyten’s Star system, specifically on a planet like GJ 273b, which, while within the habitable zone, provides no evidence to date of life or even Earth-like conditions.
- Such a civilization would need technological sophistication equivalent to or beyond Earth’s current capabilities—able to detect, decode, and appropriately respond to our radio message.
- They would have to receive the signal, interpret its mathematical and scientific content accurately, and decide to respond in a way that is intentional and unambiguously artificial.
- Their return signal would need to be sufficiently powerful, directed precisely at Earth, and timed appropriately to arrive within the 2042–2045 window.
- On Earth, our radio astronomy capabilities would need to remain sensitive enough to detect such a faint and distant signal, a task that is increasingly threatened by growing radio interference from satellite megaconstellations and terrestrial sources—a problem expected to worsen in coming decades.

The history of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) reveals a persistent lack of positive detections despite over six decades of increasingly sophisticated searches across many nearby star systems. Even with the ongoing discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets, including GJ 273b, there is no empirical evidence for life, let alone intelligent and technologically communicative civilizations beyond Earth. The compounded uncertainties at each step—from the emergence of life, through the evolution of intelligence and technology, to the choice and ability to reply—mean the probability of success for any single targeted Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) experiment is extremely low. Expert assessments from leaders in the METI field acknowledge that successful contact may require hundreds, thousands, or even millions of such transmission attempts before any positive result can be expected.

Thus, while the physical possibility exists and the timing of the experiment is well structured to allow for a detection within the next two decades, the combined weight of scientific uncertainty, technological challenges, and the consistently negative results of past searches strongly indicate that detecting an unambiguous message from Luyten’s Star before 2046 is exceedingly unlikely. The status quo of null results in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is likely to persist through the resolution of this question.
