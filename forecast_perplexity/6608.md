The current scientific consensus and evidence strongly suggest that primordial black holes (PBHs) are not the dominant component of dark matter. This conclusion is primarily due to the lack of direct observational evidence for PBHs and the strong constraints on their contribution across most mass ranges. While there is a narrow mass range where PBHs have not been entirely ruled out, alternative dark matter models, such as those involving weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions, have been more successful in explaining observed phenomena.

The scientific community tends to change its consensus slowly, especially when existing models continue to provide satisfactory explanations. Significant breakthroughs in both observational techniques and theoretical models would be required to shift the consensus toward PBHs as the main component of dark matter. Future advancements in particle physics and astrophysics could lead to the discovery of new particles or mechanisms that account for dark matter, further reducing the likelihood of PBHs being the primary component.

However, there remains a possibility that future gravitational wave observatories, such as LISA and DECIGO, could detect signals consistent with the presence of PBHs in the asteroid mass range. Such observations, combined with theoretical advancements that support the stability and abundance of PBHs, could potentially lead to a shift in the scientific consensus. Despite these possibilities, the current evidence and expert opinion suggest that the probability of PBHs making up the majority of dark matter remains low.
