## Rationale for the Imprisonment of Senior Executives of Major Public Companies for Corporate Crimes Before 2026

Imprisonment of senior executives from major public companies for corporate crimes has historically been an uncommon outcome, even in the wake of high-profile scandals and substantial financial misconduct. The pattern since the early 2000s, and especially after the 2008 financial crisis, has seen most enforcement actions resolved through civil penalties, fines, or settlements, rather than criminal convictions that result in actual prison sentences for top-level executives. Legal and procedural hurdles—including complex investigations, lengthy trials, and the potential for appeals—often delay or dilute accountability at the highest corporate levels.

Despite this entrenched status quo, the period from 2021 to 2025 features some notable exceptions in the form of live criminal cases against senior executives, particularly in Germany. The most significant and advanced of these is the Wirecard scandal. Former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun, whose company was listed on the DAX index, has been in detention since 2020 and is presently on trial for a range of serious offenses including organized fraud, falsification of financial statements, and defrauding banks of approximately €1.75 billion. This case stands out because of:

- The magnitude and clarity of the alleged fraud,
- Braun’s ongoing pre-trial detention, indicating the gravity with which authorities regard the case,
- The confidence expressed by prosecutors in securing a conviction,
- The expectation that the trial will conclude in late 2025, within the timeframe required for the outcome in question.

While a recent civil judgment against Braun and other former executives has already demonstrated the courts’ willingness to impose significant liability for fiduciary breaches, this alone does not satisfy the criteria for imprisonment. The decisive factor lies with the criminal trial’s verdict and whether Braun will begin serving a prison sentence before January 1, 2026.

The Volkswagen emissions scandal is another major case under close observation, but as of May 2025, it has not resulted in a qualifying senior executive commencing a prison sentence for corporate crimes during the relevant window. Other global cases involve executives from non-qualifying companies or have focused on mid-level managers rather than top executives.

Structural challenges persist: even with clear evidence and serious charges, high-profile white-collar cases often encounter delays—verdicts can be delivered late in the permissible window, and post-conviction appeals can postpone the actual commencement of sentences. These procedural complexities, combined with the precedent of leniency toward senior executives, contribute to the overall rarity of such imprisonments.

Nonetheless, the current enforcement environment, particularly following recent regulatory reforms and increased prosecutorial focus on financial crimes, has heightened the risk for senior executives in major markets. The Wirecard case, with its advanced legal proceedings, the scale of alleged misconduct, and the alignment of the timeline, represents a true outlier where the probability of a prison sentence commencing before the deadline is meaningfully higher than in typical years.

In summary, while the overwhelming historical trend remains one of executive impunity, the combination of an exceptionally strong live case against a former DAX-listed CEO and evolving enforcement priorities introduces a non-trivial, elevated risk that at least one senior executive could be imprisoned for corporate crimes before January 2026.
