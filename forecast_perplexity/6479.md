## Rationale for the Probability of Adversarial Use of Consumer Genomic Data Before 2030

The direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing market is expanding at a rapid pace, projected to grow from under $2 billion in 2023 to as much as $17 billion by 2033, with compound annual growth rates exceeding 24%. This surge is generating vast repositories of highly sensitive genetic and personal data held by private companies, significantly elevating the stakes for privacy, security, and the potential for adversarial exploitation.

Despite strong consumer trust in genomic companies, privacy and security practices across the industry have historically lagged behind the sensitivity of the data involved. The December 2023 breach at 23andMe, which affected nearly 7 million users, exemplifies this vulnerability. Financial distress, such as the 2025 collapse of 23andMe, can further erode data protections, with company privacy statements often permitting the transfer or sale of genetic data to new entities that may not uphold prior security standards.

A patchwork of legal protections currently governs genomic data. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) offers some safeguards, but primarily around employment and health insurance discrimination, leaving critical gaps in areas like life insurance, long-term care, and other potential uses. Proposed legislation, such as the Genomic Data Protection Act (GDPA) introduced in 2025, signals mounting legislative attention but has yet to be enacted and is unlikely to close all loopholes imminently. DTC genomics companies remain mostly outside the scope of HIPAA, operating under inconsistent consumer privacy laws which provide variable protection.

From a technical perspective, new vectors for misuse are emerging. The integration of genomic data into dynamic health platforms, often combined with other personal data streams (e.g., wearables, diet, digital health profiles), expands the attack surface. Advances in artificial intelligence and data analytics further amplify the technical feasibility of both re-identification and malicious exploitation. Recent research highlights that the entire DNA sequencing workflow contains vulnerabilities, enabling potential cybercriminal misuse for surveillance, manipulation, or even synthetic biothreats. Openly accessible DNA datasets raise the risk of adversarial actors utilizing such data for targeted harm.

The growing value of genetic information provides strong financial and strategic incentives for exploitation. Insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms, and bad actors have tangible interests in acquiring and misusing this data, particularly given the lack of comprehensive legal barriers. History from other data-rich industries suggests that, as repositories of valuable information grow, so too does adversarial interest, and breaches eventually result in documented harm to individuals.

While there have so far been no publicly documented cases precisely meeting the most stringent criteria—adversarial use of consumer genomic data, resulting in harm and reported by a major reputable source—the combination of expanding data volumes, demonstrated security lapses, incomplete regulatory protection, increasing technical feasibility, and lucrative incentives renders the risk landscape particularly acute. Regulatory and industry responses, though likely to improve over time, are lagging behind both the pace of technological advancement and the scale of current exposures.

In the years leading up to 2030, the environment for adversarial use of consumer genomic data is likely to become increasingly permissive, unless substantial and effective interventions are rapidly introduced. The potential for adversarial actors to exploit gaps—whether through breaches, manipulation, re-identification, or discriminatory use in loosely regulated domains—remains high. The precedent set by the 23andMe breach and subsequent industry disruptions underscore both the latent risk and the fact that foundational vulnerabilities persist unaddressed.

Given these conditions, it is reasonable to anticipate a substantial probability of at least one documented case of adversarial use of consumer genomic data causing harm and reported by a reputable source before 2030. The convergence of rapid industry growth, regulatory inertia, technological advancement, and financial incentives makes such an event increasingly likely in the years ahead.
