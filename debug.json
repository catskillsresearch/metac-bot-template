If this happened, there\u2019d likely be significant humanitarian harms, including more severe weather, food crises, and the spread of infectious diseases which would disproportionately affect the world\u2019s worst off.\n\nMoreover, the [estimated humanitarian impacts of climate changes are likely to be highly nonlinear](https:\/\/www.givewell.org\/shallow\/climate-change\/extreme-risks): marginal temperature increases are expected to cause more damage at already-increased temperatures (i.e. going from 3\u00baC to 4\u00baC is expected to be significantly worse than going from 1\u00baC to 2\u00baC). \n\n[According to some](https:\/\/www.givewell.org\/shallow\/climate-change\/extreme-risks), there is also a non-negligible chance \u2014 perhaps around 10% \u2014 that unmitigated emissions will lead to global temperature increases even higher than 4.8\u00baC. More generally, estimates of temperature increases resulting from greenhouse emissions have a [\u201cfat\u201d right tail](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/michael-e-mann\/the-fat-tail-of-climate-change-risk_b_8116264.html), meaning that there is a low, but non-negligible chance of very high temperature increases.\nHence, there is a non-negligible chance that unmitigated emissions may produce consequences which could be catastrophic for life on Earth. \n\nFor example, [it has been argued](https:\/\/www.givewell.org\/shallow\/climate-change\/extreme-risks#footnote7_jr7z9s5) that a 12\u00baC increase in mean global temperature\u2014which is substantially outside the range considered plausible this century\u2014would cause at least one day each year in the territories where half of all people live today to be hot enough to exceed human metabolic limits and cause tissue damage from hyperthermia after a few hours of exposure. \n\nOne way to reduce global temperatures quickly and cheaply is a form of climate engineering called [Solar Radiation Management (SRM)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solar_radiation_management), which involves [cooling the Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space](http:\/\/johnhalstead.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Halstead-Stratospheric-aerosol-injection-research-and-exist.pdf). The most researched form of SRM involves injecting aerosols into the stratosphere. Most of the evidence so far suggests that ideal SRM deployment programmes would reduce overall damages relative to an un-engineered greenhouse world. \n\nHowever, SRM brings its own risks. Of the currently known potential negative direct effects of SRM, only abrupt termination could plausibly bring about an existential catastrophe. If a very thick stratospheric veil were deployed and SRM was suddenly terminated and not resumed within a buffer period of a few months, then there would be very rapid and damaging warming. [There might also be some reasons](https:\/\/nickbostrom.com\/papers\/unilateralist.pdf) to expect the chance of at least one country to undertake climate engineering to be surprisingly high, especially when the relevant technologies are widespread, and the lack of global coordination permits each country to individually decide for or against the intervention.","18":"The United States military has long relied on aircraft carriers to project power and support its operations around the world.

Over the last two decades, rogue actors have been an increasingly prominent concern for the international community. Looking ahead, some worry that advances in certain technologies, especially biotechnology, could enable rogue actors to cause outsized harm, potentially even a major global catastrophe (e.g., Rees, 2003). APM could also enable a wider range of rogue actors to create powerful arsenals. APM could further make these arsenals smaller and thus easier to conceal. In this regard, APM could be considered similar to biotechnology. This makes for a major risk: a world in which small rogue groups can cause global harm is a fragile world to live in.\n\nAlthough only small portion of scientists might currently be working to develop self-replicating nanotech, [a recent study done for NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts](https:\/\/foresight.org\/study_finds_self-replicating_nanomachines_feasible\/) by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems suggests that a useful self-replicating machine could be less complex than a [Pentium 4 chip](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pentium_4), and uncovered no road blocks to extending macroscale systems to microscale and then to nanoscale self-replicating systems.

Each increasing level represents an accident approximately ten times more severe than the previous level.\n\nCompared to earthquakes, where the event intensity can be quantitatively evaluated, the level of severity of a man-made disaster, such as a nuclear accident, is more subject to interpretation. Because of the difficulty of interpreting, the INES level of an incident is assigned well after the incident occurs.\n\nThe INES scale consists of eight levels, with level seven - 'Major Accidents' - being the most serious. A level seven event involves a major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures.\n\nTo date, there have been two level seven Major Accidents: the [Chernobyl disaster](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chernobyl_disaster) that began on 26 April 1986, and the [Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster), a series of events beginning on 11 March 2011.\n\nAs INES ratings are not assigned by a central body, high-profile nuclear incidents are sometimes assigned INES ratings by the operator, by the formal body of the country, but also by scientific institutes, international authorities or other experts which may lead to confusion as to the actual severity.","39":"Embryo selection is a potential emerging technology and is the subject of [several previous Metaculus questions](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/?order_by=-activity&search=Embryo%20selection) and [a notebook.](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/notebooks\/9247\/polygenic-selection-of-embryos\/) \n\nOne of the most important [papers](https:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell\/pdf\/S0092-8674(19)31210-3.pdf) on embryo selection was coauthored by Israeli, Greek, and American researchers including Hebrew University's Shai Carmi, and found an expected gain of 2.5 IQ points using 2018 polygenic scores.

In the case of traits affected by simple genetic factors, it has been possible for years to change these genes, and the resulting trait(s) expressed, by means such as CRISPR\/Cas9.\n\nThe pace of genetic engineering research, as measured by papers published worldwide, shows a clear trend to be growing. There is every reason to believe that as a result of this research trend, genetic engineering technology will tend to become safer, more powerful, and less expensive with time.\n\nHuman reproduction as we typically know it results in one's genes constituting a mixture of two previously existing humans' genes which were themselves selected in this manner and so on. Artificial means of reproduction still rely on the bulk DNA transfers from existing humans. Presently, genetic engineering for new humans is [exceptional](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-00673-1), as well as taboo. \n\nThe gaussian distribution of genetic traits means that most humans won't have the most advantageous genes in most areas. Further, rather undesirable traits are ubiquitous: we all age.\n\nIf genetic engineering reaches the level where it is possible to safely and reliably eliminate the possibility of traits widely considered undesirable, such as predisposition toward schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis, or intellectual disability, there is good reason to think that humans may consider such genetic modification an ethical imperative. This is one scenario.\n\nHuman intelligence is one of the most complicated constructs of substantial genetic determination. Even so, it is possible that humanity could come by a sufficient understanding of the relationship to set humans-to-be with brains optimized to be as smart as possible. It may not be so easy to reach a consensus recognizing these types of modifications as ethnically necessary.\n\nOf course, it goes on. Any desirable trait controlled by genetics can in principle be added by genetic engineering, and any undesirable trait removed. Consequently, the space for possible legal mandates in this field is immense. \n\nOn environment: redwoods have genetics to grow very tall, but if you take one to the desert, it won't work very well (or at all).

In addition to that, Swan finds that, on average, a man today will have half of the sperm his grandfather had. \u201cThe current state of reproductive affairs can\u2019t continue much longer without threatening human survival,\u201d writes Swan, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a global existential crisis.\u201d That\u2019s not hyperbole.

In the absence of migration, a population in steady equilibrium would have a TFR of just over 2, perhaps 2.1.\n\nThe United Nation's (UN) World Population Prospects (WPP) - which necessarily incorporates TFR forecasting to make accurate predictions - is a key resource drawn upon for making informed decisions, that has been ongoing since 1992, with updates\/revisions every 2-3 years. In recent editions, the modelling has split into three components. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III. \n\nPhase I is the pre-demographic tranisiton. Usually high fertility (>7 TFR) and child mortality is observed. The UN does not model this stage (except for imputation). Phase II is what is usually described as the [demographic transition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demographic_transition) where a country declines in TFR, mortality and increases life expectancy until TFR declines below 2.1, and there's an increase in TFR for more than two consectutive years (following UN's modelling definition). A country reaching this criteria would then be designated as Phase III. As of 2022 48 countries have made it to Phase III.\n\nIt has been noted in the recent and subsequent UN WPP methodologies [(2022)](https:\/\/population.un.org\/wpp\/Publications\/Files\/WPP2022_Methodology.pdf) that Phase III countries usually increase in fertility.\n\n> A long-term assumption of a fertility increase in low-fertility countries (phase III) is supported by the experience of many countries in Europe and East Asia (Goldstein and others, 2009; Caltabiano and others, 2009; Myrskyla and others, 2009; Sobotka, 2011; Bongaarts and Sobotka, 2012; Myrskyl\u00e4 and others, 2013; Sobotka and Beaujouan, 2014). \n\nHowever...\n\n>However, such an increase is not universal (Billari, 2018; Reher, 2019). For countries that have experienced extended periods of low fertility with no empirical indication of an increase in fertility, fertility was projected to continue at low levels over the near future.\n\nThis wasn't always admitted in previous WPP, and was a point of critique among others that argued the WPP was systemically overestimating North East Asian fertility.\n\nFrom [Bayesian Population Projections for the United Nations (May, 2014)](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/262452418_Bayesian_Population_Projections_for_the_United_Nations)\n\n>Overall, the new projections were well received. However, there was one critique, relating not to the statistical method, but to the assumption in the model for TFR in Phase III that asymptotically TFR oscillates around the approximate replacement rate of 2.1, namely, that \u00b5= 2.1 in (6). Basten, Coleman and Gu (2012) argued that the UN\u2019s assumption of an eventual recovery of fertility toward replacement is not justi\ufb01ed for \ufb01ve advanced East Asian economies (Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan). They pointed out that the national statistical agencies of these countries project lower fertility rates than does the UN, that the relevant scienti\ufb01c literature does not suggest an increase in fertility in the short term, that a recent unpublished survey of experts concluded that fertility would not increase as markedly as the UN predicts, and that current evidence about fertility intentions does not suggest an immediate appetite for more children in these countries.\n\nIn retrospect; the critics were correct. The fertility from the mentioned countries has continued to decline. In response, over the years and revisions, the UN has attempted in updating their methodology to reflect this reality. \n\n>In historical revisions of the World Population Prospects, up to and including the 2010 Revision, projections assumed a long-run fertility level of 1.85 children per woman. In subsequent revisions, including the 2022 Revision, the projected level of total fertility has been allowed to fall below that threshold, reflecting uncertainty with regard to the historic minimum level of fertility at the end of phase II before the start of a recovery as part of phase III.\n\n>The unweighted mean value for the world distribution based on the 48 countries or areas that have entered phase III is 1.62 children per woman in 2100 while the 95 per cent prediction interval ranges between 1.50 and 1.75.\n\n>Once projected fertility reaches phase III (figure II.1), the second component of the projection procedure implements a time series model to further project fertility, assuming that the fertility level would approach and, in the long run, fluctuate around an ultimate country-specific level. That level is determined for each country by a Bayesian hierarchical model (Raftery and others, 2014a) informed by empirical evidence from **low-fertility countries that have experienced fertility increases from a sub-replacement level.**\n\nAlas, this seems to be insufficient; and although TFR projections have become country specific, the WPP 2022 [continues](https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/grapher\/total-fertility-rate-including-un-projections-through-2100?time=1984..2053&country=CHN~KOR~TWN~JPN~HKG~MAC), to predict a fertility rebound, despite these countries not showing any indication of this happening.\n\nOther population projections have failed to predict these countries fertility. Most recently, South Korea's fertility has [fallen below the lower bound confidence interval](http:\/\/ihmeuw.org\/5wpn) for IHME projections made in 2018. Now South Korea seems to be facing a forecasted TFR of [0.77](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/FeLDiimXEAgc222?format=png&name=large) for 2022, along with Hong Kong at 0.66 and Macao at 0.64.\n\nThis is all among the backdrop of declining [sperm counts](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/28981654\/), [unintended pregancy rates](https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/action\/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl1&pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930315-6), [teen pregnancies](https:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SP.ADO.TFRT), ageing parents, increases in inverse correlates such as educational attainment, urbanisation, and, contraceptive use; all while there is [selection for fertility](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S1090513817302799), that (theoretically) should be pushing TFR higher.\n\nFinally, one key assumption prominently stands;\n\n>While the asymptote does not have an explicit lower bound, it does implicitly because any given ***total fertility trajectory is restricted not to be\nsmaller than 0.5 child.***\n\nThus we arrive at our question.","117":"","118":"[String theory](https:\/\/math.berkeley.edu\/~kwray\/papers\/string_theory.pdf)\n\n> roughly speaking, replaces point particles by strings, which can be either open or closed (depends on the particular type of particle that is being replaced by the string), whose length, or string length, is approximately 10^(\u221233) *cm*.

It is the strongest version of the Rijndael algorithm underlying the AES specification with 14 rounds of transformation and a 256 bit key size. The key size of 256 bits appears to render a brute-force search of the keyspace infeasible on foreseeable classical and quantum computers--the latter still must search an effective keyspace of 128 bits (see Grover's algorithm). The best publicly known attack on AES-256 requires the search of a keyspace slightly greater than 254 bits, which is infeasible. This keyspace is so large that a brute force search would be energy-constrained on a solar-system scale even with unlimited computing power at the physical limits of efficiency. \n\nThere is some consideration that mathematical and \/ or cryptoanalytic advances may enable new attacks on AES-256 that could make key recovery computationally feasible. Public, and presumably private, cryptanalysis of AES-256 is ongoing so it is plausible that by some means a practical break could become public knowledge by 2040.

Outlays also occur when interest on the Treasury debt held by the public accrues and when the government issues bonds, notes, debentures, monetary credits, or other cash-equivalent instruments in order to liquidate obligations. Also, under credit reform, the credit subsidy cost is recorded as an outlay when a direct or guaranteed loan is disbursed. An outlay is not recorded for repayment of debt principal, disbursements to the public by federal credit programs for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 1992 or later, disbursements from deposit funds, and refunds of receipts that result from overpayments. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years (prior-year obligations) or in the same year. Outlays, therefore, flow in part from unexpended balances of prior-year budgetary resources and in part from budgetary resources provided for the year in which the money is spent.\n\nIn 2024, federal government outlays were \\$6.75 trillion and made up 23% of the US's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.3847\/0004-6256\/151\/2\/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/2016AJ....151...22B\/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/2017AJ....153...91M\/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https:\/\/ui.adsabs.harvard.edu\/abs\/2017AJ....153...27G\/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough.

The AFI evaluates five key indicators of academic freedom, including the freedom to research and teach, freedom of academic exchange and dissemination, institutional autonomy, campus integrity, and freedom of academic and cultural expression. The index currently covers 179 countries and territories, and is considered the most comprehensive dataset available on the subject of academic freedom. The index employs a methodology that includes assessments by 2,197 country experts, standardized questionnaires, and a well-established statistical model, implemented and adapted by the [V-Dem project](https:\/\/v-dem.net\/). The 2023 report (of the period up to December 2022) places the United States of the America in the Top 40-50% bracket (pg. 2-3) and outlines the following threats to academic freedom: \n\n> China, India, the United States of America and Mexico are among the most populous countries where academic freedom has significantly fallen back over the past decade. These developments have occurred in different political settings and do not all follow the same pattern.\n\n> The United States of America presents a different picture. **After a long period of relatively high academic freedom levels, four out of five indicators visibly declined in 2021** \u2013 the year after President Donald Trump, who repeatedly made statements highly critical of science and academia, was voted out of office. Although some federal actions detrimental to academic freedom were taken during his administration, educational matters in the USA are largely regulated by individual states, which have increasingly used their authority to interfere in academic affairs since 2021. At least nine states, all Republican-led, have adopted bills that ban the teaching of concepts related to \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in higher education institutions. Several states are also targeting tenure in public universities, adding to the already precarious status of academic employment. Some states now also allow students to record class lectures without the professor\u2019s consent. Furthermore, influential conservative groups are lobbying state legislatures to withdraw funding from scientific fields such as gender, minority studies, and environmental science, and various groups are maintaining public \u201cwatchlists\u201d of professors perceived as radical leftists. Despite efforts to polarize and intimidate, AFI data on academics\u2019 freedom of expression indicates that scholars in the USA remain able to publically voice their expertise, even on politically salient issues.","233":"In 2008, science fiction author, Robert Silverberg, penned a provocative web essay, [The Death of Galium](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080704170435\/http:\/\/www.asimovs.com\/_issue_0806\/ref.shtml), that predicted that we would collectively run out of several essential, rare elements within a single decade.

For example, the Fed in the US communicates the stance of monetary policy through its target for the federal funds rate (FFR); the Bank of England communicates the stance of monetary policy through its direct control of the official bank rate. (This in contrast to e.g. Milton Friedman's famous [proposal](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friedman%27s_k-percent_rule) for a rule for the growth rate of the monetary base.) \n\nSince all interest rates in an economy are linked by arbitrage pressure, the Fed by controlling the FFR can affect more general interest rates facing consumers and businesses \u2013 such as interest rates on bank deposits. The consensus understanding of monetary policy is that by controlling the current and expected future path of these interest rates, central banks can influence economic activity: GDP, inflation, unemployment, and other metrics.\n\nHowever, it has long been believed that central banks cannot push their policy rates much below zero. This is because of a no-arbitrage relation with physical cash. By holding physical cash, you can guarantee yourself a 0% nominal return: if you have 100 dollars in cash in your wallet today, you can ensure that you'll have 100 nominal dollars in your wallet next year, therefore guaranteeing a 0% nominal return. Thus, if the central bank tried to set its policy rate to cause the nominal bank deposit rate to be (say) -20%, then most everyone would pull their money out of the banking system and hold cash instead, to obtain the higher interest rate. ([This is essentially a form of Gresham's Law](http:\/\/jpkoning.blogspot.com\/2016\/11\/a-modern-example-of-greshams-law.html): central banks peg physical cash and bank reserves at a 1:1 rate; but the rate of return on the two need not be the same.)\n\nThis zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates however is not a hard limit: because of the costs and inconvenience of storing cash and preventing theft, individuals and firms are willing to accept a somewhat negative nominal interest rate. Indeed, in Europe, the policy rate has been slightly negative since 2014, and this has spilled over to interest rates facing households, such as [mortgage rates in Denmark](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2019\/aug\/13\/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage).\n\nIn the United States, unlike the ECB in the Eurozone, the Fed has been unwilling to target a policy rate even modestly below zero.

Some are considered suitable for specific tasks, while others have broader applications. For those studying or seeking programming-related employment it is essential to understand which PLs are currently relevant to increase their chances of finding a job.\n\nThe question itself is tricky. How can we measure the popularity of a PL? One way is to measure the percentage of PLs used in [GitHub projects](https:\/\/octoverse.github.com\/2022\/top-programming-languages). However, not every company uses GitHub repositories; there are alternatives such as GitLab, GitFlic, etc. Additionally, some companies use their local servers to store their projects, making it challenging to gather such information.\n\nAnother method of measuring PLs' popularity is by calculating ratings based on the hits from popular search engines, similar to what the [TIOBE index](https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/programminglanguages_definition\/) does. This approach is more suitable and can provide us with more representative and extensive data because most languages are continually evolving. Even experienced programmers need to stay updated with newly introduced changes.\n\nAs of March 5, 2024, Python is considered the most popular language according to the TIOBE Index. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability through significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in data science, machine learning, web development, etc.\n\nWhile popularity alone is not the sole factor for those choosing their future study area, understanding trends can be helpful.

Another possible intentional nuclear war is between India and Pakistan. The two countries have gone to war four times since then, in 1947, 1965, 1974 and 1999, and have been on the brink of war as recently as 2008.

Several facilities existed in the US starting in the 1960s, which often relied on funding from the living relatives of the cryopreserved, and could not maintain conditions when relatives were no longer willing or able to pay. As a result, all but one of the documented cryonic preservations prior to 1973 ended in failure, and the thawing out and disposal of the bodies.\n\nYou can find more specific information about the history of brain preservation on [this page](https:\/\/timelines.issarice.com\/wiki\/Timeline_of_brain_preservation) by Metaculite Mati Roy.\n\nLesswrong user Froolow wrote [a financial analysis of Alcor](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/B8Lu238n4ReCcebhP\/how-long-will-alcor-be-around).

Bostrom states the following:\n\n>\"So what kind of thing would count as a fundamental change in the human condition? \n\n>\"You could argue that if we look back over history, there has really only been two events that have fundamentally changed the human condition, the first being [the Agricultural Revolution some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago in Mesopotamia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neolithic_Revolution), where we transitioned from being hunter-gatherers, small bands roaming around, to settling into cities, growing, domesticating crops and animals. With that you get social stratification, if there is a lot of grain, you could have a king or pharaoh who extracts the surplus, you can have standing armies, you can have war, you can have higher population densities, specialisation of labour, and from that point on, innovation grows much faster and population grows faster as well as a result.\n\n>\"The second fundamental change in the human condition, [Industrial Revolution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Industrial_Revolution), where for the first time, you have the rate of economic and technological growth outstripping population growth, and so only when this happens can you have an increase in average income. Before that, there was technological growth and economic growth, but the economy grew 10%, the population grew 10%, everybody's still in a [Malthusian condition](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Malthusianism).\"\n\nBostrom further argues that there are relatively few potential technologies that could have the same kind of impact, and that perhaps foremost among them is [machine intelligence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence).\n\nThe kind of discontinuity in the human condition seen as a result of the agricultural and industrial revolutions is substantial; human civilisation became markedly more complex, acquired fundamentally new abilities, and the human experience became radically different after each of these events.\n\nThe question we ask here is: **Before January 1 2100, will the human condition change fundamentally to at least roughly the same extent that it did after the agricultural and industrial revolutions?**\n\n\"The human condition,\" for the purposes of this question, is the general level of social complexity, economic productivity, and ability to manipulate physical reality humanity has achieved at the civilisational level. \n\nThe discontinuity can be in either direction - though it seems improbable that Metaculus would continue to exist if humanity were to revert to a pre-industrial state.\n\nEvents that may occur this century, but which do not appear to represent a discontinuity of approximately the same degree as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, include (among other things) the establishment of bases or settlements on other bodies in the solar system, the achievement of modest to moderate life extension (e.g. an additional 10 to 30 years of life) or a significant but not radical increase in economic productivity.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nIf at any time after the date of 2025-01-01 both the community and Metaculus predictions are >= 98% or <= 2%, with 80% probability, the question resolves positively or negatively, respectively. With 20% probability, the question resolves according to a committee of 5 Metaculus admins, who will vote yes or no (not ambiguous), and will unmake their respective predictions so that they do not gain or lose points on the question.\n\nNote that the admins will be voting on whether the qualifying event has already happened, not whether they believe it will happen; for example, if the probability goes to 99% because a super-powerful AI seems immininent within 10 years, but it has not actually happened yet, the committee should unanimously vote no.\n\nIf the question has not resolved by January 1 2100, it resolves ambiguously.","24":"This resolves positively if Stacey Abrams is elected president in or before 2040 and the result is not overturned prior to inauguration, whether or not she is actually inaugurated.

In 2018, Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak\u2014prompted by Valery Novoselov, an assistant professor of gerontology and geriatrics at RUDN University in Moscow\u2014uploaded a paper to ResearchGate, subsequently [published](http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/rej.2018.2167) in the journal _Rejuvenation Research_, challenging this view. Zak argued that the person who died in 1997 was Jeanne Calment's daughter, Yvonne Calment (born 29 January 1898), who upon Jeanne's death in 1934 assumed her official identity for tax evasion purposes.\n\nVersions of this \u201cidentity switch hypothesis\u201d had been advanced in the past (including by [fellow Metaculites](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/348\/will-one-of-the-verified-oldest-living-persons-in-the-world-reach-120-years-old-by-the-23rd-of-march-2024\/#comment-2084)), but it was only with the publication of Zak\u2019s paper and its popularization and further development by life-extension activist Yuri Deigin in [a series of blog posts](http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pbio.3000148.s001) that the thesis attracted widespread attention and discussion. The main facts adduced in support of this hypothesis are, to quote from Gwern's useful [summary](https:\/\/www.gwern.net\/Questions#jeanne-calment), \"the suspiciousness of the Calment family archives being destroyed by them, some anomalies in Calment\u2019s passport, oddities in family arrangements, apparent inconsistency of Calment\u2019s recollections & timing of events & photos, facial landmarks like ear features not seeming to match up between young\/old photos, and an obscure 2007 accusation in a French book that a French bureaucrat and\/or the insurance company had uncovered the fraud but the French state quietly suppressed the findings because of Calment\u2019s national fame.\"\n\nThe response of the professional community of demographers has been generally skeptical. Jean-Marie Robine, a respected scholar who co-validated Calment's longevity record, was [particularly critical](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2019\/01\/12\/how-madame-calment-worlds-oldest-person-became-fuel-russian-conspiracy-theory\/): \"You can talk with any scholar, who would say, we would not accept this even from a student. It\u2019s not scientific, there\u2019s no methodology, no hypothesis, no nothing.\" His colleague and co-author Michel Allard also criticized the study, though he [noted](https:\/\/af.reuters.com\/article\/worldNews\/idAFKCN1OX14T) that \"even if far-fetched, the Russians\u2019 conclusions should be given consideration.\" After a \"rather tense\" meeting of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in early 2019, longevity experts from France, Swiss and Belgium concluded that an exhumation may be needed to settle the controversy.\n\nMore recently, it has been discovered that blood samples taken from Mme Calment have been preserved by the [Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fondation_Jean_Dausset-CEPH) in Paris. Furthermore, [researcher Phil Gibbs](https:\/\/the110club.com\/did-jeanne-calment-really-reach-122-t3663-s315.html#p40063394) and [gerontologist Aubrey De Grey](https:\/\/www.connexionfrance.com\/French-news\/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122) independently noted that, because of inbreeding, Yvonne Calment had only 12 great-great-grandparents, whereas Jeanne Calment had the usual 16. Thus, the true identity of Mme Calment could be straightforwardly established by conducting a single DNA test on a blood sample already in possession of a laboratory.\n\nIn light of this, we now ask: **Conditional on relevant DNA tests being carried out, will it be shown that Mme Calment was Jeanne Calment?**\n\n##Resolution\n\nThe question will resolve before the official resolution date (January 1, 2030) if and when the results of a DNA test of Mme Calment, following either an exhumation of her body or an analysis of a preserved blood sample, are officially announced. The resolution will then be determined as follows:\n\n1. If the DNA of the exhumed body or the blood sample is shown to be that of someone with 12 great-great-grandparents, the question resolves negative; if it is shown the be that of someone with 16 great-great-grandparents, it resolves positive; otherwise, it resolves ambiguous.\n\n2. If the official body of Yvonne Calment is also exhumed and tested, the question resolves negative if DNA testing shows Mme Calment to be Yvonne Calment, and positive otherwise.\n\n3. In the unlikely event that both of the criteria above become relevant and yield inconsistent resolutions, the question will resolve according to criterion (2).\n\nIn all these cases, the question will retroactively close one week before the test results are officially announced.\n\nIf the question doesn't resolve before the official resolution date, it will resolve ambiguous.\n\n## Further reading\nIn addition to the writings listed above, readers may want to consult the following papers:\n\n* Zak & Gibbs, [A Bayesian Assessment of the Longevity of Jeanne Calment](http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/rej.2019.2227) (in favor of the ID switch hypothesis).\n\n* Robine, Allard, Herrmann & Jeune, [The Real Facts Supporting Jeanne Calment as the Oldest\nEver Human](http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/gerona\/glz198) (against the ID switch hypothesis).","75":"In the last few months, the star Betelgeuse has [dimmed in the sky](http:\/\/www.astronomerstelegram.org\/?read=13410), prompting some media outlets to speculate that it will soon be observed to go supernova.

Yet, despite the mounting evidence of fish sentience, and the substantial numbers involved in aquaculture, fish are currently excluded from much of the European Slaughter Regulation ([European Union, 2009](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF)). \n\nThe key principle however, that animals \u201cshall be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations\u201d, does apply to fish ([European Union, 2009](https:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF); p.9). Humane slaughter methods should therefore be used, ensuring that fish are effectively stunned prior to killing or killed with a method that guarantees an immediate loss of consciousness.\n\nThe main farmed species in the EU are: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, common carp, European sea bass, gilthead sea bream, turbot, North African catfish, European eel, and Atlantic Bluefin tuna (ordered by greatest tonnage). Humane stunning systems exist or can be developed for all of these, but progress towards this goal varies for each species.([Compassion in World Farming, 2018](https:\/\/www.compassioninfoodbusiness.com\/media\/7434891\/ciwf-2018-report__the-welfare-of-farmed-fish-during-slaughter-in-the-eu.pdf))\n\nThere is legislation in place to regulate the slaughter of animals in the European Union.

As explained therein, this is due to differences in physiology and slaughter context, and less developed understanding of the stunning process for fish. However, it is stated explicitly that the key principle remains applicable to fish, which states that (Article 3(1)):\n\n>Animals shall be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations. \n\nAccordingly, there is a legal requirement for member states to take action to avoid, or at least minimise, the suffering of fish at slaughter.\n\nAdvocacy groups have suggested using stunning techniques. In 2009, the Animal Health and Welfare panel (EFSA) recommended the \u201curgent development of commercial stunning methods to induce immediate (or rapid) unconsciousness in\u2026 seabream\u201d ([EFSA, 2009](http:\/\/edepot.wur.nl\/7878), p. 2).\n\nHowever, the [Humane Slaughter Association (2018)](https:\/\/www.hsa.org.uk\/downloads\/hsafishslaughterreportfeb2018.pdf) points out that further development of humane stunning techniques is required for a greater range of species of finfish than current techniques currently permit, to suit their various rearing environments and to minimise handling and movement prior to death which can cause stress and chemical and physical deterioration in product quality.\n\n**By the end of 2029, will the European Union enact legislation or a directive that requires commercially farmed fish to be stunned before being slaughtered?**\n\n-----\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThis question resolves positively if by the end of 2029, the European Union enacts legislation or a directive that requires at least 50% of all commercially farmed fish in the European Union to be stunned before slaughter by any method method that renders the fish immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to slaughtering them for food. Positive resolution requires this legislation or directive *to have come into effect* before the end of 2029. Methods for stunning include percussive or electrical stunning. Live chilling, or asphyxiation in any manner (e.g., air, CO2) are not qualifying stunning procedures.","89":"Elon Musk's dream of a hyperloop \u2013 a pod-based transportation system that uses magnetic levitation in a near-vacuum \u2013 is coming closer to reality.

The issue is that the values determined by these two independent methods have now widened to the point where there is a significant statistical difference of approximately 4 to 5 sigma between the two, despite the increasing precision of each method's results over time. This difference is now widely considered among experts as having become a problem for the [\u039bCDM standard model of cosmology](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lambda-CDM_model) (or even, among some, as a crisis). Continuing observational projects and theoretical work have been dedicated at attempts to understand and resolve the discrepancy.\n\nA mid-July 2019 [workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB](https:\/\/www.kitp.ucsb.edu\/activities\/enervac-c19) was convened to bring together both experimental and theoretical researchers in the field to review and assess the current state of affairs and identify promising next steps at resolution. The coordinators for this event drafted a paper [Tensions between the Early and the Late Universe](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1907.10625) summarizing the event proceedings.  An image from this paper plotting the different values determined by the various methods is [at this link](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iDBM8hD.jpg). \n\nVideos and slides of the talks are available [at this conference website link](http:\/\/online.kitp.ucsb.edu\/online\/enervac-c19\/).

As an overview for possible ways forward, a new paper, [The Hubble Hunter's Guide](https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1908.03663), attempts \"to consider the broadest possible set of potential cosmological solutions to reconcile\" the opposing observations.\n\nThe question asks:\n\n**By 01-Jan-2030, will the source(s) of the current tension in H0 results be resolved without a need to replace the \u039bCDM standard cosmological model?**\n\nA [criteria that was suggested for determining consensus on a resolution](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/questions\/3021\/will-the-significant-discrepancies-in-the-measured-values-of-the-hubble-constant-h_0-be-resolved-by-2030\/#comment-15872) is to poll researchers working on this issue near the question close date, asking what sigma they ascribe to the discrepancy, assuming \u039bCDM. A positive resolution results if the mean of replies by at least 5 polled cosmologists is < 2 sigma. A mean of > 4 sigma resolves as negative; between 2 and 3 is an indeterminate resolution.  \n\nFootnote: Examples of early universe methods - Planck, DES+BAO+BBN versus late time methods - SH0ES, CCHP, H0LiCOW, MIRAS, Megamasers, Surface Brightness Fluctuations.

This is an ultra-important question, but not the biggest possible one: we can widen our question to whether \"The Universe\" will end.  \n\nEven posing this question is not very straightforward, as \"The Universe\" has come to mean a great variety of things, from the *observable* universe that we see through telescopes, all the way through various types of [multiverses](http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/multiverse).  So let's start with some definitions.\n\nWhen we view a particular epoch of the universe through electromagnetic (and now gravitational!) radiation, we are seeing a two-dimensional sphere that we can think of as the \"sky\" at some \"distance.\"  Assembling these nested spheres back to around the [nucleosynthesis era](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis) era gives a ball of about [46.5 billion light years](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Observable_universe) in radius.  This [\"observiball\"](http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/science-environment-19373118) can also be thought of as a past [\"lightcone,\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Light_cone) and  this lightcone and its interior constitute a [3+1 dimensional spacetime](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spacetime) region containing every post-nucleosynthesis event that occurred to our past from which information can have reached us traveling at the speed of light or less.\n\nTurning this around to look into the future, we can consider the \"Affectiball,\" or future lightcone, which bounds the region of spacetime that we, here and now on Earth, could reach with sub-lightspeed travel or signaling.  Assuming that no future technology allows faster-than-light information transfer (or at least does so only within regions of spacetime [pre-engineered](http:\/\/www.physics.uofl.edu\/wkomp\/teaching\/spring2006\/589\/final\/wormholes.pdf) for this purposed), everything humanity will ever do or cause will sit within this Affectiball.\n\nWe can now ask whether this *Affectiball* (and its interior) goes on forever, or ends.  This really contains two questions.  First, will the *spacetime* go on forever, or terminate in a singularity like the [big crunch](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Big_Crunch)?  Second, will interesting things continue to happen forever, or will the Affectiball approach some sort of equilibrium [\"heat death\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_death_of_the_universe)?

AI still has a significant impact on the world (so it\u2019s not the same as a \u201ccryptocurrency fizzle\u201d), but relative to current expectations, this would be considered a disappointment.  Rather than the industrial or computer revolutions, AI might be compared in this case to nuclear power: people were initially thrilled about the seemingly limitless potential, but decades later, that potential remains mostly unrealized.\n\n**Futurama**. In this scenario, AI unleashes a revolution that\u2019s entirely comparable to the scientific, industrial, or information revolutions (but \u201cmerely\u201d those).  AI systems grow significantly in capabilities and perform many of the tasks currently performed by human experts at a small fraction of the cost, in some domains superhumanly.  However, AI systems are still used as tools by humans, and except for a few fringe thinkers, no one treats them as sentient.  AI easily passes the Turing test, can prove hard theorems, and can generate entertaining content (as well as deepfakes). But humanity gets used to that, just like we got used to computers creaming us in chess, translating text, and generating special effects in movies.\n\n**AI-Dystopia**. The technical assumptions of \u201cAI-Dystopia\u201d are similar to those of \u201cFuturama,\u201d but the upshot could hardly be more different.  Here, again, AI unleashes a revolution on the scale of the industrial or computer revolutions, but the change is markedly for the worse.  AI greatly increases the scale of surveillance by government and private corporations.  It causes massive job losses while enriching a tiny elite.  It entrenches society\u2019s existing inequalities and biases.  And it takes away a central tool against oppression: namely, the ability of humans to refuse or subvert orders.\n\n**Singularia**. Here AI breaks out of the current paradigm, where increasing capabilities require ever-growing resources of data and computation, and no longer needs human data or human-provided hardware and energy to become stronger at an ever-increasing pace.  AIs improve their own intellectual capabilities, including by developing new science, and (whether by deliberate design or happenstance) they act as goal-oriented agents in the physical world.  They can effectively be thought of as an alien civilization\u2013or perhaps as a new species, which is to us as we were to Homo erectus. Fortunately, though (and again, whether by careful design or just as a byproduct of their human origins), the AIs act to us like benevolent gods and lead us to an \u201cAI utopia.\u201d  They solve our material problems for us, giving us unlimited abundance and presumably virtual-reality adventures of our choosing.\n\n**Paperclipalypse**.  In \u201cPaperclipalypse\u201d or \u201cAI Doom,\u201d we again think of future AIs as a superintelligent \u201calien race\u201d that doesn\u2019t need humanity for its own development.  Here, though, the AIs are either actively opposed to human existence or else indifferent to it in a way that causes our extinction as a byproduct.  In this scenario, AIs do not develop a notion of morality comparable to ours or even a notion that keeping a diversity of species and ensuring humans don\u2019t go extinct might be useful to them in the long run.  Rather, the interaction between AI and Homo sapiens ends about the same way that the interaction between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals ended.\n\n***While this question is unlikely to resolve in the event humanity does go extinct, we consider questions of this type to be important sources of information and request that forecasters predict their true beliefs.***","135":"","136":"Any conflicts between the US military and the armed forces of another country will be excluded from consideration in this question.
