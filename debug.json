Boasting a \\$437 billion package, the aims of the law are to reduce the deficit, lower the price of prescription drugs and spur investment into clean energy.\n\nDespite its namesake and sweeping economic policies, the law was widely referred to as \"Biden's Climate Bill\" and was considered to be the largest and most significant US climate legislations ever with an aim to tackle climate change by cutting some four billion tonnes greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to achieve this aim includes:\n\n* Tax rebates for qualifying electric vehicles.\n* Consumer tax breaks for renewable energy investments in wind and solar.\n* Business tax credits for clean energy manufacturing and production of wind, solar and nuclear power technologies as well as carbon capture technology.\n* Imposition of fees for excessive methane flaring and venting from oil and gas drilling.\n\nTrump - a climate change skeptic - has been scathing of the IRA and has taken executive action to scale back the law (see Colombia Law School's [Climate Backtracker](https:\/\/climate.law.columbia.edu\/content\/climate-backtracker)).\n\n***\n\nAccording to the [US Department of Energy](https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/articles\/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources):\n\n> The Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit creates a new 10-year incentive for clean hydrogen of up to \\$3.00\/kilogram. For qualifying clean hydrogen, the credit provides a varying, four-tier incentive depending on the carbon intensity of the hydrogen production process.\n\nHydrogen is seen by many as an option to be a mainstream alternative, low carbon fuel. Clean (or green) hydrogen (i.e., produced with a low carbon intensity) is a key criterion for the tax credit. Production of green hydrogen is cost-intensive process thus scrapping of the tax credit system is likely to spell disaster for the few green hydrogen projects still considering final investment.\n\nIn the latter stages of his Presidency, [Biden loosened the 45V qualifying rules](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2025-01-03\/biden-loosens-strict-rules-for-hydrogen-subsidies-worth-billions), allowing more carbon intensive hydrogen production methods to qualify for the tax credits (one example being being natural gas with carbon capture - commonly referred to as blue hydrogen).\n\nMarty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute, [commented](https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/energy\/u-s-chamber-statement-on-45v-tax-credit) on the modification of the rule, stating:\n\n> \u201cThe incoming Administration will have an opportunity to improve the 45V rules to ensure the industry will attract the investments necessary to scale the hydrogen economy and help the U.S. lead the world in clean manufacturing.\u201d","11":"The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022, established several clean energy tax credits including:&#x20;\n\nSection 48E (ITC) - The [Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/clean-electricity-investment-credit), also known as 48E due to it being in that section of the tax code, is an investment tax credit (ITC) for companies that invest in zero-greenhouse gas energy generation (such as solar and nuclear), storage (e.g., [Tesla Megapacks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tesla_Megapack)) and any related equipment needed.

However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius<\/u>*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthinsurance.org\/glossary\/individual-mandate\/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees<\/u>](https:\/\/www.cigna.com\/employers\/insights\/informed-on-reform\/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/shots-health-news\/2024\/11\/21\/nx-s1-5198483\/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting<\/u>](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/how-plans-set-your-premiums\/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee<\/u>](https:\/\/hern.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/07\/27\/539907467\/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote).

While it provides a framework for the upcoming fiscal year, it does not become law and does not require the president\u2019s signature. Importantly, the budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions, which direct specific congressional committees to draft legislation that meets the resolution\u2019s fiscal goals. These instructions are optional but allow for the creation of a [reconciliation bill](https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation), which allows the Senate to pass certain budget-related laws with a simple majority vote and limited debate, bypassing the [filibuster](https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/about\/powers-procedures\/filibusters-cloture.htm).\n\nIf reconciliation instructions are included, the resulting reconciliation bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the president to become law.

Changes to mandatory spending programs (like Medicare, [Medicaid](https:\/\/usafacts.org\/articles\/how-much-of-the-federal-budget-is-mandatory-spending\/), or Social Security), however, require standalone legislation that amends the law governing those programs. These also must pass both chambers and be signed by the president, and they generally face a higher procedural hurdle in the Senate due to the possibility of a filibuster.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans have passed separate budget resolutions in March and April 2025, with the Senate version calling for approximately \\$4 billion in spending cuts, and the House version aiming for \\$1.5 trillion in cuts.

Reconciliation also limits debate time, preventing the use of the filibuster altogether.\n\nA key priority expected to be included in a reconciliation bill is the renewal of [Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act) - a central pillar of his campaign, with most of them set to expire at the end of 2025.

Additionally, Trump and the GOP have suggested using reconciliation to pass policies related to border security and energy permitting, though the impact of these measures on federal spending is less clear.\n\nSome senior Republicans argue that border security constitutes a national emergency.
