Eric Drexler & Toby Ord of the Future of Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, the Drake's Equation was run as a Monte Carlo Simulation rather than a point estimate using the following distributions for the parameters of the Drake's Equation;\n\nParameter Distribution:\n\n- \\(R_\u2217\\) log-uniform from 1 to 100.\n- \\(f_p\\) log-uniform from 0.1 to 1.\n- \\(n_e\\) log-uniform

running Monte Carlo simulation more reflective of the possible outcomes of the Drake's Equation.\n\nSome of the paper's (and see also [this

choices for parameter distributions are surprising such as \\(f_p\\) which is unlikely to resolve to be significantly less than 1, unless I'm mistaken.\n\nIt would also be fun to see if the distribution of resolutions to Drake's Equation derived using Metaculus-determined parameter distribution, would match the distribution produced by directly asking Metaculus how Drake's Equation will resolve.","3":"Neuroscientist and fiction author Erik Hoel wrote the following about electric cars in the year 2050 in a [blog post published August 25,

Relative to the total light-duty vehicle (LDV) market, total PEV shares grew from 1.9% in 2019 to 2.1% in 2020, as the overall LDV sales reduced by nearly 15% in 2020. \n\nThe same report defines PEVs as plug-in electric vehicles, and BEV and PHEV in the quote as follows\n\n>There are two types of PEVs: battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are powered exclusively by electricity, while plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have a battery as well as a separate internal combustion engine for extended driving range.\n\nUsing the numbers above, we can estimate that BEVs were approximately 1.6% of all LDV sales in the US in 2020.\n\nMonthly updates from the Argonne National Laboratory show PEVs sold as a share of LDVs sold [increasing to above 3.5% in 2021](https:\/\/www.anl.gov\/es\/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates) (using data through September of 2021).\n\nThe Argonne National Laboratory defines LDVs as vehicles weighing less than 10,000 pounds.\n\nBEVs were 1.4% of new vehicle sales in the US in 2020 according to IEA.

He died in 1940 of consequences from an infection.\n\nOther people have crested the 8' tall mark, but they are few and far between, and no one's come close to Wadlow's record, at least according to the [officials at Guinness](http:\/\/www.guinnessworldrecords.com\/world-records\/tallest-man-ever\/).\n\nCan people ever grow to 9 feet tall or even beyond? This [article from The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2004\/may\/06\/thisweekssciencequestions3) points out that: \n\n> Normally, the growth of our bones is limited by our sex hormones. A good burst of sex hormones at the right time tells the ends of our bones to stop growing. In acromegalic gigantism, as the tumour grows, it destroys cells in the pituitary gland that stimulate the release of sex hormones. The bones, therefore, never get the signal to stop growing.\n\n> But surely there must be a limit to a person's height? John Wass, a specialist in acromegalic gigantism at the University of Oxford, reckons it would be impressive to survive for long if you grew taller than 9ft. \n\nHere's why Wass thinks 9 feet tall is a ceiling, so to speak: \n\n* blood pressure in the legs would be extreme and dangerous\n* keeping blood circulating in such a person would strain the heart to the breaking point\n\n[Gizmodo points out](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/5994755\/how-tall-can-a-human-get) that: \n\n> the primary [obstacle to mega growth] is our environment. Gravity, and the limited buoyancy of the air around us, means that our bones would have to grow exponentially larger to support a human that towered ten to twelve feet tall. \n\nAnd this [New York Times piece](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/08\/30\/science\/30qna.html) quotes Dr. Rob DeSalle, of the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, who says: \n\n> Many joint disorders and bone problems exist for these individuals that impact average-height people much less.

For example, the Fed in the US communicates the stance of monetary policy through its target for the federal funds rate (FFR); the Bank of England communicates the stance of monetary policy through its direct control of the official bank rate. (This in contrast to e.g. Milton Friedman's famous [proposal](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friedman%27s_k-percent_rule) for a rule for the growth rate of the monetary base.) \n\nSince all interest rates in an economy are linked by arbitrage pressure, the Fed by controlling the FFR can affect more general interest rates facing consumers and businesses \u2013 such as interest rates on bank deposits. The consensus understanding of monetary policy is that by controlling the current and expected future path of these interest rates, central banks can influence economic activity: GDP, inflation, unemployment, and other metrics.\n\nHowever, it has long been believed that central banks cannot push their policy rates much below zero. This is because of a no-arbitrage relation with physical cash. By holding physical cash, you can guarantee yourself a 0% nominal return: if you have 100 dollars in cash in your wallet today, you can ensure that you'll have 100 nominal dollars in your wallet next year, therefore guaranteeing a 0% nominal return. Thus, if the central bank tried to set its policy rate to cause the nominal bank deposit rate to be (say) -20%, then most everyone would pull their money out of the banking system and hold cash instead, to obtain the higher interest rate. ([This is essentially a form of Gresham's Law](http:\/\/jpkoning.blogspot.com\/2016\/11\/a-modern-example-of-greshams-law.html): central banks peg physical cash and bank reserves at a 1:1 rate; but the rate of return on the two need not be the same.)\n\nThis zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates however is not a hard limit: because of the costs and inconvenience of storing cash and preventing theft, individuals and firms are willing to accept a somewhat negative nominal interest rate. Indeed, in Europe, the policy rate has been slightly negative since 2014, and this has spilled over to interest rates facing households, such as [mortgage rates in Denmark](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/money\/2019\/aug\/13\/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage).\n\nIn the United States, unlike the ECB in the Eurozone, the Fed has been unwilling to target a policy rate even modestly below zero.

Some are considered suitable for specific tasks, while others have broader applications. For those studying or seeking programming-related employment it is essential to understand which PLs are currently relevant to increase their chances of finding a job.\n\nThe question itself is tricky. How can we measure the popularity of a PL? One way is to measure the percentage of PLs used in [GitHub projects](https:\/\/octoverse.github.com\/2022\/top-programming-languages). However, not every company uses GitHub repositories; there are alternatives such as GitLab, GitFlic, etc. Additionally, some companies use their local servers to store their projects, making it challenging to gather such information.\n\nAnother method of measuring PLs' popularity is by calculating ratings based on the hits from popular search engines, similar to what the [TIOBE index](https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/programminglanguages_definition\/) does. This approach is more suitable and can provide us with more representative and extensive data because most languages are continually evolving. Even experienced programmers need to stay updated with newly introduced changes.\n\nAs of March 5, 2024, Python is considered the most popular language according to the TIOBE Index. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability through significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in data science, machine learning, web development, etc.\n\nWhile popularity alone is not the sole factor for those choosing their future study area, understanding trends can be helpful.

Another possible intentional nuclear war is between India and Pakistan. The two countries have gone to war four times since then, in 1947, 1965, 1974 and 1999, and have been on the brink of war as recently as 2008.

If collatz() always halts, then collatz_halts() definitely exists, because the answer is 1 for all inputs. If collatz_program() only halts for some n, then collatz_halts() might or might not exist.\n\nNote that if the Collatz Conjecture is false for only a finite number of inputs, then collatz_halts() exists, since the program could test against an enumeration of the the inputs for which collatz() does not halt.

This is an ultra-important question, but not the biggest possible one: we can widen our question to whether \"The Universe\" will end.  \n\nEven posing this question is not very straightforward, as \"The Universe\" has come to mean a great variety of things, from the *observable* universe that we see through telescopes, all the way through various types of [multiverses](http:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/multiverse).

Assuming that no future technology allows faster-than-light information transfer (or at least does so only within regions of spacetime [pre-engineered](http:\/\/www.physics.uofl.edu\/wkomp\/teaching\/spring2006\/589\/final\/wormholes.pdf) for this purposed), everything humanity will ever do or cause will sit within this Affectiball.\n\nWe can now ask whether this *Affectiball* (and its interior) goes on forever, or ends.

Second, will interesting things continue to happen forever, or will the Affectiball approach some sort of equilibrium [\"heat death\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heat_death_of_the_universe)?

Wild animal suffering has historically been discussed in the context of the philosophy of religion as an instance of the problem of evil. More recently, a number of academics have considered the suspected scope of the problem from a secular standpoint as a general moral issue, one that humans might be able to take actions toward preventing.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, reducing wild animal suffering is a mainstream moral issue if ANY of the following become true before 2200.\n\n1. At least three reliable polls reveal that at least 30% of representative adults in the United States agree that we should reduce wild animal suffering AND the poll clarifies that reducing wild animal suffering may run counter to traditional environmentalist ideals of ANY of biodiversity, habitat preservation, ecosystem health.\n\n2. Legislation is passed in the United States which is widely recognized as having goals to reduce wild animal suffering from natural causes. A Metaculus moderator agrees that such legislation is roughly aligned with the spirit of Brian Tomasik or David Pearce's written work on wild animal suffering, and is ambitious in scope.\n\n3. There are university courses on [welfare biology](https:\/\/www.animal-ethics.org\/wild-animal-suffering-section\/introduction-to-welfare-biology\/) in at least 10 accredited American universities. A Metaculus moderator judges that these courses teach welfare biology as the concept is understood in 2020, and more narrowly, \"a research field devoted to studying the wellbeing of animals in general, and focused especially on animals in their natural ecosystems.\"\n\n4. A protest aimed at raising awareness of wild animal suffering attracts at least 10,000 people as reported by at least 2 reliable media sources. A Metaculus moderator agrees that the protest goals are roughly aligned with the spirit of Brian Tomasik or David Pearce's written work on wild animal suffering.\n\n6. A major political party includes wild animal suffering as part of their platform. A Metaculus moderator agrees that the party goals are roughly aligned with the spirit of Brian Tomasik or David Pearce's written work on wild animal suffering.\n\n5.
