Federal and State officials will carefully evaluate your farm and work with you to figure out the best option for meeting the goal of 24-hour depopulation.\n> \u00a0\n> In every case, we take the decision very seriously and weigh many factors when choosing what depopulation method to use. These include, among other things, the size and type of the animals, their behavior, and their containment\/housing facilities. We also look at the number of animals in the flock, the location of the farm and environmental conditions there, disease information, and available resources and personnel.\n\nThe USDA maintains a page [tracking the number of confirmed HPAI detections](https:\/\/www.aphis.usda.gov\/livestock-poultry-disease\/avian\/avian-influenza\/hpai-detections\/commercial-backyard-flocks) in commercial and backyard flocks, as well as the number of \"Birds Affected\" in those flocks.

Reports of Maersk ships traveling the Red Sea will also resolve the question as **Yes** if, in the judgment of Metaculus, the event represents a change to official Maersk policy, allowing its ships to travel through the Red Sea.\n* Reports that this will happen at some point in the future will only resolve this question as **Yes** if that point is within the calendar year 2025 *and* that date is reached without a significant change in plans.","31":"\\- This question will resolve to Yes only if the United States and Danish governments formally and publicly announce negotiations, such as via a press conference, official statement, etc.\n\n\\- This question will not resolve to Yes if it is only reported via news organizations that there are back channel, private, or other non-public negotiations\/discussions occurring between officials in the two governments.\n\n\\- Metaculus will resolve this question according to official announcements from the United States and Denmark before January 1, 2026, Eastern Time.","32":"","33":"","34":"* A \"joint statement\" refers to a document that is explicitly authored or endorsed by each party. A technical paper does not qualify.\n\n* \"committing to constrain their AI's capabilities\" will be interpreted narrowly. For example, a commitment to prevent certain types of restricted speech, or a commitment to always do Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, will not qualify. The constraints must be on the general capabilities of the AIs - for example, committing to not using more than a certain amount of compute, or committing to not deploying a model until it verifiably cannot perform certain tasks, such as recursive self-improvement.","35":"\u2022 The relevant survey will probably be published by [ <u>El Pa\u00eds<\/u> ](https:\/\/elpais.com\/noticias\/barometro-el-pais\/).\n\n \u2022 Voting intention refers specifically to the 18-24 age group and to direct voting intention data, as presented in the 40dB survey.

A statement by Trump saying he could invoke the adjournment power would not qualify.\u00a0\n\n\\- If President Trump has not formally adjourned Congress before January 1, 2026, Metaculus will resolve this question as No based on information published by [<u>credible sources<\/u>](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).","37":"\u2022 Established franchises or cinematic universes must cover the same universe. For example, both the '28 Days Later' series and the 'Before' Trilogy would count as franchises, while 'Venom,' when it first premiered, would not be considered part of a franchise.\n\n \u2022 A movie that is a *remake* automatically makes it part of a franchise.\n\n \u2022 A film that has an announced sequel will count as part of a franchise."},"question_type":{"0":"binary","1":"binary","2":"binary","3":"binary","4":"binary","5":"binary","6":"binary","7":"binary","8":"binary","9":"binary","10":"binary","11":"binary","12":"binary","13":"binary","14":"binary","15":"numeric","16":"numeric","17":"numeric","18":"binary","19":"numeric","20":"binary","21":"binary","22":"binary","23":"binary","24":"binary","25":"binary","26":"binary","27":"binary","28":"binary","29":"binary","30":"binary","31":"binary","32":"numeric","33":"binary","34":"binary","35":"binary","36":"binary","37":"binary"},"question_options":{"0":"[]","1":"[]","2":"None","3":"[]","4":"None","5":"[]","6":"[]","7":"[]","8":"[]","9":"[]","10":"[]","11":"None","12":"[]","13":"None","14":"[]","15":"None","16":"None","17":"None","18":"[]","19":"[]","20":"None","21":"[]","22":"[]","23":"None","24":"[]","25":"[]","26":"[]","27":"[]","28":"None","29":"[]","30":"[]","31":"[]","32":"[]","33":"None","34":"None","35":"[]","36":"[]","37":"[]"},"question_group_variable":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":""},"question_question_weight":{"0":1.0,"1":1.0,"2":1.0,"3":1.0,"4":1.0,"5":1.0,"6":1.0,"7":1.0,"8":1.0,"9":1.0,"10":1.0,"11":1.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"18":1.0,"19":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":1.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":1.0,"26":1.0,"27":1.0,"28":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"31":1.0,"32":1.0,"33":1.0,"34":1.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0},"question_unit":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"deaths\/year","16":"months","17":"hours","18":"","19":"birds","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"members","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":""},"question_open_upper_bound":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":true,"16":true,"17":true,"18":null,"19":true,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":true,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null},"question_open_lower_bound":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":true,"16":true,"17":true,"18":null,"19":true,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":false,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null},"question_scaling_range_max":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":5000000.0,"16":360.0,"17":37.0,"18":null,"19":75000000.0,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":40.0,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null},"question_scaling_range_min":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":100.0,"16":2.0,"17":31.0,"18":null,"19":15000000.0,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":0.0,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null},"question_scaling_zero_point":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":0.0,"16":null,"17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null},"crowd":{"0":0.5,"1":0.2,"2":0.57,"3":0.35,"4":0.12,"5":0.45,"6":0.22,"7":0.14,"8":0.9,"9":0.75,"10":0.3,"11":0.9,"12":0.99,"13":0.1,"14":0.31,"15":{"10":10526.7177311801,"20":16559.8747040407,"40":46037.6941135908,"60":676388.0718683149,"80":4783197.6619040351,"90":4956904.4929835564},"16":{"10":4.2674523525,"20":5.7443553819,"40":13.4534201982,"60":32.6616009573,"80":71.8178374201,"90":337.5725338528},"17":{"10":31.1537134159,"20":31.3090007728,"40":32.1916701798,"60":35.10012144,"80":36.4832711717,"90":36.8091781184},"18":0.3,"19":{"10":16420664.2317279018,"20":17236387.8247420453,"40":21734191.6390692517,"60":44751579.147597596,"80":62251841.4534031302,"90":67127794.2755194306},"20":0.06,"21":0.98,"22":0.4,"23":0.006,"24":0.43,"25":0.6,"26":0.001,"27":0.55,"28":0.06,"29":0.2,"30":0.6,"31":0.009,"32":{"10":0.0625007689,"20":0.6235926322,"40":1.0262750174,"60":1.1527401908,"80":13.7786288425,"90":38.2809068856},"33":0.1,"34":0.1,"35":0.5,"36":0.05,"37":0.92}}
