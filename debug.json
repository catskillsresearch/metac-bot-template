Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/bird-flu\/php\/avian-flu-summary\/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) reported since 1997 are available.\r\n\r\nCDC maintains a [Current Situation Summary](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/bird-flu\/situation-summary\/index.html) for H5 influenza, where as of October 18, 2024, detections in the US are listed as widespread for wild birds, sporadic for poultry flocks and mammals, and a total of 27 cases in humans in the US. It also describes person-to-person spread as \"None\" and a low current public health risk.\r\n\r\nHistorically, there have been concerns about much wider spread. In 2005, after confirmation of two cases of human-to-human contact, Scott Gottlieb, then a Clinical Assistant Professor at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, [wrote](https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC546057\/) in the British Medical Journal of the confirmation of these H2H transmissions \"raising the possibility that the infection could soon gain a foothold among people, with the potential to strike millions.\" As of yet in the present outbreak, however, there is [not yet](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/bird-flu-concerns-mount-california-reports-more-human-cases) a concern about h2h transmission. \r\n\r\nHowever, as Pasquale Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb [write](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41567-020-0921-x#citeas):\r\n\r\n>We examine the distribution of fatalities from major pandemics in history (spanning about 2,500 years) [...] Using tools from extreme value theory (EVT), we show that the distribution of the victims of infectious diseases is extremely fat-tailed, more than what one could be led to believe from the outset.","1":"Donald Trump has announced several Cabinet picks for a potential second term, including Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense.

Some of the published proposals are:\n\n* [<u>Proposals from chapter 14 about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<\/u>](https:\/\/static.project2025.org\/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf) from the[ <u>Project 2025 Policy Agenda<\/u>](https:\/\/www.project2025.org\/policy\/)\n* The Republican Study Committee's[ <u>FY 2025 Budget Proposal<\/u>](https:\/\/hern.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87)\n* A[ <u>2023 opinion piece<\/u>](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/4-ways-repeal-obamacare) by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n* A[ <u>paper from the Paragon Health Institute<\/u>](https:\/\/paragoninstitute.org\/private-health\/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud\/), a health policy research institute run by[ <u>Brian Blase<\/u>](https:\/\/paragoninstitute.org\/profile\/brian-blase\/), former economic policy advisor during Trump's first term\n\nThe ACA is lengthy and complex, but the Republican proposals generally focus on a few key aspects, described below alongside other potential targets:\n\n* **Reducing Medicaid eligibility and expenses:** The ACA expanded federal Medicaid eligibility to households with income of 133% of the federal poverty line or less ([<u>see ACA Section 2001<\/u>](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/111\/plaws\/publ148\/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), effectively this threshold is [<u>138%<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/medicaid-chip\/medicaid-expansion-and-you\/) after accounting for other income adjustments in the law). However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius<\/u>*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthinsurance.org\/glossary\/individual-mandate\/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees<\/u>](https:\/\/www.cigna.com\/employers\/insights\/informed-on-reform\/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/shots-health-news\/2024\/11\/21\/nx-s1-5198483\/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting<\/u>](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/how-plans-set-your-premiums\/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee<\/u>](https:\/\/hern.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/07\/27\/539907467\/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote).

[Many see AI as a solution to the current productivity crisis](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/how-will-ai-affect-productivity\/), and it is in the midst of an \u2018[AI Boom](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AI_boom)\u2019, with global spending on AI expected to reach [$632 billion by 2028](https:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52530724), according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). \n\nThis has led to new and rapid advancements in the field. OpenAI, for example, the AI research organization behind ChatGPT, has launched its [\u2018Strawberry\u2019 AI model](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/artificial-intelligence\/openai-launches-new-series-ai-models-solve-hard-problems-2024-09-12\/), capable of \u2018reasoning\u2019 through tasks and problems rather than generating a quick response. Likewise, the technology giant NVIDIA \u2014 a dominant supplier of AI hardware and software \u2014 has released its own open-source AI model, [NVLM 1.0](https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/software-apps\/nvidia-just-debuted-its-new-open-source-advanced-ai-model-with-state-of-the-art-capabilities-to-take-on-openais-magical-gpt-4o).\n\nWhile AI is therefore seen as an essential tool moving forward, there are also great concerns with the technology. There has been a marked increase in the use of AI to spread disinformation, with [fake images](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/04\/08\/business\/media\/ai-generated-images.html), [videos](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/02\/07\/technology\/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html), and even [fake voice recordings](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/technology-68074257), designed to mimic politicians or celebrities, being widely propagated online, especially on [platforms such as X (formerly Twitter)](https:\/\/misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu\/article\/the-spread-of-synthetic-media-on-x\/). AI is also being utilized for criminal purposes. Gangs in Asia, for instance, are [\u201c[l]everaging technological advances \u2026 to produc[e] larger scale and harder to detect fraud, money laundering, underground banking[,] and online scams\u201d](https:\/\/www.unodc.org\/roseap\/en\/2024\/10\/cyberfraud-industry-expands-southeast-asia\/story.html), according to Masood Karimipour, a regional representative of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). \n\nAs a result, there has been a push to regulate AI at the government level. The European Union (EU), for example, implemented the [Artificial Intelligence Act](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_Intelligence_Act) which came into force on 1 August 2024, establishing a common regulatory and legal framework for AI within the EU. Likewise, there has been a similar push to regulate AI at a federal level in the United States. In 2022, the White House released its \u2018[AI Bill of Rights](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/ostp\/ai-bill-of-rights\/)\u2019 and, in 2023, President Joe Biden signed [Executive Order 14110](https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefing-room\/presidential-actions\/2023\/10\/30\/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence\/), defining the administration\u2019s policy goals regarding AI and directing executive agencies to pursue them. Despite this, the [United States lacks any overarching federal regulation](https:\/\/www.morganlewis.com\/pubs\/2024\/04\/existing-and-proposed-federal-ai-regulation-in-the-united-states), meaning AI in the US is currently governed by a mixture of federal and state law, the industry itself, and the judiciary.\n\nGiven that the pace of AI development continues to grow, the question arises as to whether the US government will adopt federal regulations for AI, or whether the [$146 billion industry](https:\/\/www.precedenceresearch.com\/us-artificial-intelligence-market) will continue under its current patchwork regulatory regime.","20":"[<u>The Insurrection Act<\/u>](https:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/our-work\/research-reports\/insurrection-act-explained) grants the president authority to deploy the US armed forces for domestic law enforcement purposes without specifying the conditions under which this authority may be used.","21":"[Chatbot Arena](https:\/\/lmarena.ai\/) is a platform for crowdsourced AI comparisons, hosted by researchers at UC Berkeley.
