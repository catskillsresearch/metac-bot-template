Though plenty of our attention in this hunt has been focused on studying potentially habitable exoplanets, this question is concerned with the likelihood of finding [extraterrestrial life](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extraterrestrial_life#Planetary_habitability_in_the_Solar_System) in our own cosmic backyard."},"question_resolution_criteria":{"0":"This question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any point between January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2050, a scientific consensus is reached that life exists or has existed anywhere in our Solar System besides Earth, as judged by Metaculus Admins.\n\nFor this question, we exclude any extra-terrestrial life which has been placed outside Earth through intentional or unintentional human activity.
