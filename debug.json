While the filibuster has been modified in recent years\u2014such as in 2013 ([<u>for executive and judicial nominees except the Supreme Court<\/u>](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/senate-nuclear-filibuster-rules\/story?id=20964700)) and 2017 ([<u>for Supreme Court nominees<\/u>](https:\/\/constitutioncenter.org\/blog\/senate-kills-supreme-court-filibuster-in-historic-moment))\u2014the 60-vote requirement for standard legislation has remained intact.\n\nAccording to the US Senate's [power and procedures guide](https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/about\/powers-procedures\/filibusters-cloture.htm):\n\n> The Senate tradition of unlimited debate has allowed for the use of the filibuster, a loosely defined term for action designed to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote on a bill, resolution, amendment, or other debatable question. Prior to 1917 the Senate rules did not provide for a way to end debate and force a vote on a measure. That year, the Senate adopted a rule to allow a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster, a procedure known as \"cloture.\" In 1975 the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture from two-thirds of senators voting to three-fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn, or 60 of the 100-member Senate.\n\nThe upshot of the Senate's procedural rules is that it creates a practical requirement that any non-budgetary bill have 60 votes in the chamber to pass. With the Senate at the time of this question being 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, that means that the vast majority of bills needing passage in the Senate must have at least 7 Democratic votes. One recent example has been the Laken Riley Act, which passed with 64 votes in the Senate, [including](https:\/\/rollcall.com\/2025\/01\/20\/democrats-senate-laken-riley-act\/) 11 Democrats. From the standpoint of the US government, the filibuster serves as a check on the power of the majority party, which becomes especially poignant when one party controls all three of the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate.&#x20;\n\nAccording to political scientist Robert Van Houweling [arguing against](https:\/\/news.berkeley.edu\/2021\/06\/15\/the-filibuster-a-tool-for-compromise-or-a-weapon-against-democracy\/) the filibuster when Democrats were in power in 2021, \"The filibuster is straightforwardly anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic.\" At the time the Senate filibuster was blocking Democratic agenda items from being passed, such as the \\$15 minimum wage and improved voting rights legislation. However, in the two months following the January 20, 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump, Democrats in the Senate used the filibuster to prevent the passage of the following bills:\n\n* Barring transgender girls from competing in female sports ([NY Times](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/03\/03\/us\/politics\/democrats-transgender-girls-sports.html))\n* Creating criminal penalties for abortion providers ([NY Times](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/01\/22\/us\/politics\/senate-abortion-vote-republicans.html))&#x20;\n* Imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court due to the ICC's prosecution of Israeli officials for war crimes in Gaza ([CNN](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/28\/politics\/senate-vote-icc-sanctions\/index.html))\n\nSenate rules [were changed](https:\/\/www.americanbar.org\/advocacy\/governmental_legislative_work\/publications\/governmental_affairs_periodicals\/washingtonletter\/2013\/november\/filibuster\/) in 2013 to allow a simple majority to invoke cloture on presidential nominees other than the Supreme Court, and then in 2017 the rules were [further changed](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/crs-product\/R44819) for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed with a simple majority.

For consumers, a dominant dollar, working through the exchange rate, reduces the cost of imports, making it easier to purchase cheap goods from abroad. The dollar\u2019s global reserve status reduces the chance that the U.S. will face a currency crisis, in which a sudden devaluation of the dollar could halt imports, deteriorate the terms of trade, and cause a financial crisis. (This also works in reverse: Other countries become more susceptible to the dollar and U.S. financial conditions.) In addition, the ubiquity of the dollar gives the United States power over the international financial system\u2014most notably in the form of sanctions.\n\nIn November 2024, Donald J.

The implications for the US dollar are dire for trade around the world, as it cuts off the needed supply of dollars to keep the wheels of the global USD system turning, ironically risking a powerful spike higher in the US dollar. Instead, safety valves are found, as global financial actors scramble for alternatives. China and the BRICS+ transact with gold-backed digital money and, to a degree, directly in a new gold-backed offshore yuan. Europe rebases its trading relationships increasingly in the euro. Gold-linked crypto stablecoins add to the mix, as this dramatic new chapter in global financial markets begins.\n\n> Potential market impact: The crypto market quadruples to more than USD 10 trillion, the US dollar falls 20% against major currencies and 30% versus gold. The US economy continues to reflate, but wages keep up with goods inflation, as production resources reshore to the US. US exporters advantaged.\n\nAdditionally, economists at BNP Parabas have [pointed out](https:\/\/economic-research.bnpparibas.com\/html\/en-US\/Could-Trump-drive-down-dollar-1\/21\/2025,51217) that President Trump views the strong dollar as an impediment to strengthening US industry, so it is certainly possible that policies may move toward a weakening dollar, although at the same time there are other factors like the dollar's status as a \"safe haven\" in times of major economic uncertainties and new geopolitical tensions which could ironically drive the dollar higher.\n\nFor further information please see:&#x20;\n\n* The Atlantic Council [Dollar Dominance Monitor](https:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/programs\/geoeconomics-center\/dollar-dominance-monitor\/)\n* Steptoe [Shifts in Global Trade Landscape Accelerating Risks of De-Dollarization](https:\/\/www.steptoe.com\/en\/news-publications\/stepwise-risk-outlook\/stepwise-risk-outlook-deep-dive-shifts-in-global-trade-landscape-accelerating-risks-of-de-dollarization.html)\n* Investec: [The dollar in a multipolar world](https:\/\/www.investec.com\/en_za\/focus\/economy\/the-dollar-in-a-multipolar-world.html)\n* Wikipedia: [Reserve currency](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reserve_currency)","16":"*This forecasting question is associated with the Verity controversy:* Will the United States take control of the Panama Canal?\n\n[<u>The Panama Canal<\/u>](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panama_Canal) is an artificial waterway which cuts across Panama, a country in Latin America, and connects the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.

If the position is abolished while she is the holder, the question will resolve as Yes.","35":"* [ <u>CompaniesMarketCap<\/u> ](https:\/\/companiesmarketcap.com\/european-union\/largest-companies-in-the-eu-by-market-cap\/) or an equivalent reliable source will be used as a reference.\n * If specific data is not available for December 31, 2025, the last year-end closing will be used.","36":"\\- The DOJ must publicly and officially announce the initiation of an investigation or prosecution against the individual.\n\n\\- The resolution does not require a conviction or final outcome\u2014only the announcement of a formal investigation or prosecution.\n\n\\- For clarity, the question includes impeachment managers formally appointed for Trump\u2019s impeachment proceedings and leadership roles active as of the time of the DOJ\u2019s announcement.\n\n\\- Metaculus will resolve this question based on [<u>credible sources<\/u>](https:\/\/www.metaculus.com\/faq\/#definitions).","37":"* Unofficial reservations or leaks do not qualify unless corroborated by an authorized announcement.","38":"\u2022 If the Copernicus Climate Change Service\/ECMWF does not publish such a report or data by 7 January 2026, this question will be resolved based on their latest data or estimates, or the equivalent NASA report or data.

In the event a presidential action would satisfy the above, the question will resolve as **Yes** if the action has taken effect for 60 consecutive days without being stayed, blocked, or otherwise halted by a federal court. In the event a presidential action is temporarily blocked by a court but later goes into effect for 60 days the question will resolve as **Yes**. The 60 day period must complete before January 1, 2026.\n* Partial termination or partial elimination of funding is not sufficient.\n* PEPFAR being renamed will not count, as long as the core mission of funding global AIDS\/HIV prevention and treatment remains intact within the same program.","41":"\\- The invocation must explicitly invoke the Insurrection Act or make reference to the legal provisions under the Act.

Alternative sources should follow similar methodology as the one outlined by the [U.S. Press Freedom Tracker](https:\/\/pressfreedomtracker.us\/frequently-asked-questions\/):\n\n> The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker adopts a functional definition of who is a journalist. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the individual has a press pass or went to journalism school, whether they work for The New York Times or work for themselves. What matters is whether the person was performing an act of journalism. The Tracker will count journalists whose rights to gather and disseminate information were violated in the course of their work or as a result of their work.","44":"\u2022 The relevant survey will probably be published by [ <u>El Pa\u00eds<\/u> ](https:\/\/elpais.com\/noticias\/barometro-el-pais\/).\n\n \u2022 Voting intention refers specifically to the 18-24 age group and to direct voting intention data, as presented in the 40dB survey.
