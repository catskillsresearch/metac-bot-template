A contest begins when the incumbent resigns or when at least 15 percent of Conservative MPs submit letters to its chair, triggering an internal confidence vote among all Conservative MPs. If the leader loses that vote, a leadership campaign begins, and MPs hold successive ballots to reduce the field to two candidates, the finalists are then put to a postal ballot of the wider party membership.","1":"Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization.

This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem.

The base value of the \u00a745Y credit mirrors the legacy \u00a745 PTC, at 0.3 cents per KWh (adjusted for inflation), increased to 1.5 cents per KWh for facilities that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) standards.\n\n> Companies can increase the value of the \u00a745Y tax credit by siting a project in a designated energy community, satisfying [domestic content adder](https:\/\/www.cruxclimate.com\/insights\/domestic-content-safe-harbor) requirements, and\/or qualifying for a [low-income bonus](https:\/\/www.cruxclimate.com\/insights\/low-income-community-bonus-credit-begins-today) for projects smaller than 5MWac. The value of each bonus adder increases the base value (either 0.3 cents or 1.5 cents) by 10%, except for certain low-income bonuses, which increase the value by 20%.\n\nAn analysis by Rhodium Group [estimated](https:\/\/rhg.com\/research\/tech-neutral-tax-credits-electric-power\/) that that clean energy tax credits including 45Y could drive 146 to 308 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy generation capacity in America's electrical grid by 2030 and 259-648 GWs by 2035.&#x20;\n\nIn the 2022 general election, Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. They made [several attempts](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/) to repeal various parts of the IRA, including clean energy tax credits such as 45Y, although it is important to note that most were symbolic efforts since Democrats controlled the Senate and the White House. According to the [Brookings Institution](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta\/):\n\n> Republican lawmakers have cited the cost of the IRA as one of the reasons to roll it back\u2014for example, the House Committee on Ways and Means has [highlighted](https:\/\/gop-waysandmeans.house.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/230421-Two-Pager-Green-Energy-Credits-FINAL.pdf) the \u201cexploding\u201d cost of \u201cgreen corporate welfare\u201d under the IRA.

Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term. Brookings continues:\n\n> While it is easier for the IRA to be repealed under a Republican trifecta, it may be difficult to build a sufficiently large coalition in Congress to repeal the full IRA, as Republican lawmakers may prefer to retain certain IRA incentives that benefit their constituents. In August 2024, 18 Republican House Representatives [signed](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2024\/08\/25\/republican-fight-inflation-reduction-act-00176223) a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) that asked for the IRA\u2019s energy tax credits to be \u201cspared\u201d from attempts to repeal the IRA. A Senior Tax Policy Advisor on the Senate Finance Committee also [noted](https:\/\/tax.thomsonreuters.com\/news\/senate-tax-advisor-new-energy-credits-likely-safe-from-full-repeal-in-2025\/) that a full repeal of clean energy tax incentives is unlikely regardless of the election results, as some parts of the IRA received bipartisan support before its enactment, which was expected to continue.\n\n> Republican-held areas have benefitted from the IRA since its enactment, as [more than half](https:\/\/e2.org\/reports\/clean-economy-works-two-year-review-2024\/) of announced clean energy and vehicle projects are located in Republican congressional districts. According to the Rhodium Group and MIT\u2019s [Clean Investment Monitor](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/database), Nevada and Wyoming had the highest level of actual clean investment as a percent of GDP between September 2023 and September 2024 \u2013 with 2.65% and 4.11% respectively. Nevada, Kentucky, and Georgia had the highest levels of actual clean manufacturing investment as a percent of GDP over the same period, with 1.1% for Georgia and Kentucky, and 1.2% for Nevada. In terms of federal investments, the most populous states, such as California and Texas, [received](https:\/\/www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org\/reports\/tallying-the-two-year-impact-of-the-inflation-reduction-act) the most dollars. However, Nevada and Wyoming received the most federal investments per capita, as well as relative to the size of their GDP. This includes federal tax credits, grants, and fiscal cost of loans and loan guarantees.\n\n> The Political Economy Research Institute (University of Massachusetts Amherst) [projected](https:\/\/peri.umass.edu\/images\/publication\/BIL_IRA_CHIPS_9-18-23-1.pdf) that the IRA could have an employment impact of creating 848,728 jobs annually, across industries. Clean Jobs America [estimated](https:\/\/cleanjobsamerica.e2.org\/) that there has been an increase of 14% in clean energy workers since the enactment of the IRA in August 2022,[<sup>2<\/sup>]() with 3.5 million workers in clean energy. Many of these jobs are in California (544,604 jobs), Texas (268,035 jobs), and New York (173,731 jobs).\n\nIn addition to a repeal of 45Y, another possibility would be earlier sunsets of the tax credit, which currently benefits energy production facilities placed into service after 2024 and before 2032. For that reason, as a \"[thoughtful](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/)\" alternative the 2032 phase-out might be moved to an earlier year.

Additionally, there is a [safe harbor](https:\/\/www.solarpowerworldonline.com\/2025\/01\/what-does-safe-harboring-mean-for-the-solar-industry\/) for clean energy projects, which grandfathers in projects that have begun before the phase-out date, as long as the project has met certain thresholds, and a repeal of 45Y or earlier sunset might be mitigated by including a safe harbor possibility to protect investments.&#x20;","20":"In recent years, President Donald Trump has [<u>asserted<\/u>](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/timeline-donald-trumps-election-denial-claims-republican-politicians\/story?id=89168408) the existence of rampant election fraud, but has provided [<u>little to no evidence<\/u>](https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/articles\/widespread-election-fraud-claims-by-republicans-dont-match-the-evidence\/) to back up these assertions.

As of February 2025, Republican Senators [had introduced](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/autos-transportation\/republican-senators-call-1000-tax-new-ev-sales-pay-road-repairs-2025-02-12\/) two bills, one to eliminate the tax credit and another to impose a brand new \\$1,000 tax on EVs.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/research\/all\/federal\/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation\/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA.

In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/27\/us\/politics\/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.","25":"The US Senate filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to invoke cloture and bring most legislation to a floor vote, has been a defining feature of Senate procedure for decades. While the filibuster has been modified in recent years\u2014such as in 2013 ([<u>for executive and judicial nominees except the Supreme Court<\/u>](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Politics\/senate-nuclear-filibuster-rules\/story?id=20964700)) and 2017 ([<u>for Supreme Court nominees<\/u>](https:\/\/constitutioncenter.org\/blog\/senate-kills-supreme-court-filibuster-in-historic-moment))\u2014the 60-vote requirement for standard legislation has remained intact.\n\nAccording to the US Senate's [power and procedures guide](https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/about\/powers-procedures\/filibusters-cloture.htm):\n\n> The Senate tradition of unlimited debate has allowed for the use of the filibuster, a loosely defined term for action designed to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote on a bill, resolution, amendment, or other debatable question. Prior to 1917 the Senate rules did not provide for a way to end debate and force a vote on a measure. That year, the Senate adopted a rule to allow a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster, a procedure known as \"cloture.\" In 1975 the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture from two-thirds of senators voting to three-fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn, or 60 of the 100-member Senate.\n\nThe upshot of the Senate's procedural rules is that it creates a practical requirement that any non-budgetary bill have 60 votes in the chamber to pass. With the Senate at the time of this question being 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, that means that the vast majority of bills needing passage in the Senate must have at least 7 Democratic votes. One recent example has been the Laken Riley Act, which passed with 64 votes in the Senate, [including](https:\/\/rollcall.com\/2025\/01\/20\/democrats-senate-laken-riley-act\/) 11 Democrats. From the standpoint of the US government, the filibuster serves as a check on the power of the majority party, which becomes especially poignant when one party controls all three of the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate.&#x20;\n\nAccording to political scientist Robert Van Houweling [arguing against](https:\/\/news.berkeley.edu\/2021\/06\/15\/the-filibuster-a-tool-for-compromise-or-a-weapon-against-democracy\/) the filibuster when Democrats were in power in 2021, \"The filibuster is straightforwardly anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic.\" At the time the Senate filibuster was blocking Democratic agenda items from being passed, such as the \\$15 minimum wage and improved voting rights legislation. However, in the two months following the January 20, 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump, Democrats in the Senate used the filibuster to prevent the passage of the following bills:\n\n* Barring transgender girls from competing in female sports ([NY Times](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/03\/03\/us\/politics\/democrats-transgender-girls-sports.html))\n* Creating criminal penalties for abortion providers ([NY Times](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2025\/01\/22\/us\/politics\/senate-abortion-vote-republicans.html))&#x20;\n* Imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court due to the ICC's prosecution of Israeli officials for war crimes in Gaza ([CNN](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2025\/01\/28\/politics\/senate-vote-icc-sanctions\/index.html))\n\nSenate rules [were changed](https:\/\/www.americanbar.org\/advocacy\/governmental_legislative_work\/publications\/governmental_affairs_periodicals\/washingtonletter\/2013\/november\/filibuster\/) in 2013 to allow a simple majority to invoke cloture on presidential nominees other than the Supreme Court, and then in 2017 the rules were [further changed](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/crs-product\/R44819) for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed with a simple majority. From a predictive standpoint it's important to note that filibuster rules themselves can ironically be changed in the Senate through a simple majority vote, in a parliamentary procedure known as the [Nuclear Option](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_option), which was used in the 2013 and 2017 rule changes.&#x20;\n\nGiven the closely divided nature of the Senate and potential shifts in party control, changes to the filibuster rule during the second Trump term remain a possibility, particularly if a slim Senate majority believes it is necessary to pass key legislative priorities.\n\nIn 2017 during his first term, President Trump called for the Senate to end the filibuster, [tweeting](https:\/\/x.com\/realDonaldTrump\/status\/908640949605163010), \"With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather than 51.

Boasting a \\$437 billion package, the aims of the law are to reduce the deficit, lower the price of prescription drugs and spur investment into clean energy.\n\nDespite its namesake and sweeping economic policies, the law was widely referred to as \"Biden's Climate Bill\" and was considered to be the largest and most significant US climate legislations ever with an aim to tackle climate change by cutting some four billion tonnes greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to achieve this aim includes:\n\n* Tax rebates for qualifying electric vehicles.\n* Consumer tax breaks for renewable energy investments in wind and solar.\n* Business tax credits for clean energy manufacturing and production of wind, solar and nuclear power technologies as well as carbon capture technology.\n* Imposition of fees for excessive methane flaring and venting from oil and gas drilling.\n\nTrump - a climate change skeptic - has been scathing of the IRA and has taken executive action to scale back the law (see Colombia Law School's [Climate Backtracker](https:\/\/climate.law.columbia.edu\/content\/climate-backtracker)).\n\n***\n\nAccording to the [US Department of Energy](https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/articles\/clean-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-45v-resources):\n\n> The Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit creates a new 10-year incentive for clean hydrogen of up to \\$3.00\/kilogram.

Clean (or green) hydrogen (i.e., produced with a low carbon intensity) is a key criterion for the tax credit. Production of green hydrogen is cost-intensive process thus scrapping of the tax credit system is likely to spell disaster for the few green hydrogen projects still considering final investment.\n\nIn the latter stages of his Presidency, [Biden loosened the 45V qualifying rules](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2025-01-03\/biden-loosens-strict-rules-for-hydrogen-subsidies-worth-billions), allowing more carbon intensive hydrogen production methods to qualify for the tax credits (one example being being natural gas with carbon capture - commonly referred to as blue hydrogen).\n\nMarty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute, [commented](https:\/\/www.uschamber.com\/energy\/u-s-chamber-statement-on-45v-tax-credit) on the modification of the rule, stating:\n\n> \u201cThe incoming Administration will have an opportunity to improve the 45V rules to ensure the industry will attract the investments necessary to scale the hydrogen economy and help the U.S. lead the world in clean manufacturing.\u201d","65":"The Ibex 35 is the main stock market index of the Madrid Stock Exchange.

According to [The Hill](https:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/healthcare\/5033563-nursing-home-staffing-rule-repeal-expected\/), there are at least three mechanisms by which the staffing rule could be stopped:\n\n1. Legislation passed in Congress, including through the budget and appropriation process, which requires only a simple majority due to Senate Reconciliation rules.\n2. Being overturned by courts.\n3. CMS under the new Donald Trump administration could roll back or eliminate the rule.\n\nNotably, on April 3, 2025, government lawyers working for the Department of Justice under the Trump Administration [filed a strong defense](https:\/\/news.bloomberglaw.com\/daily-labor-report\/trumps-doj-voices-support-for-biden-nursing-home-staffing-rule) of the minimum staffing rule in a court case that was seeking to overturn it, which indicates President Trump might support the requirement.","80":"Nvidia is a leading technology company specializing in AI and graphics processors.

The credit has a base of 6% of the investment, which can rise up to 30% if certain wage and apprenticeship requirements are met, and up to 50% if additional domestic content and location requirements are met.&#x20;\n\nThe 48E tax credit was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and took effect for new zero-GHG facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2025. (For more information, see Columbia University's [Inflation Reduction Act Tracker](https:\/\/iratracker.org\/programs\/ira-section-13102-renewable-energy-investment-tax-credit\/).) 48E is currently scheduled to phase out at the later of either 2032 or when United States greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are less than or equal to 25% of 2022 emissions.\n\nWith the November 2024 election of Donald Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, the future of 48E, along with other clean energy tax credits, has been thrown into uncertainty.

According to Climate Power\u2019s [IRA repeal votes tracker](https:\/\/climatepower.us\/research-polling\/inflation-reduction-act-repeal-votes-tracker\/), as of October 15, 2024, the attempts to roll back the IRA have repeatedly focused on preventing funding for Executive Order 14082 (which helps implement the IRA), repealing sections related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and repealing sections related to the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.\n\nSome conservatives have advocated for repealing clean energy tax credits such as 48E as soon as possible, while others [have advocated for](https:\/\/www.eenews.net\/articles\/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits\/) a more \"thoughtful\" approach, using earlier phase-outs rather than quick repeal, in order to provide companies with some visibility in their project planning. Republicans hold a slim majority of 5 seats in the House, and many representatives come from districts that benefit from renewable energy investments and are facing re-election battles in 2026.&#x20;\n\nAccording to one expert forecast from the 600-attorney corporate law firm of Crowell & Moring, 48E is considered a \"[moderate](https:\/\/www.crowell.com\/en\/insights\/client-alerts\/clean-energy-tax-credits-and-after-the-election-what-to-expect)\" risk of repeal, due to the perceived cost of the tax credit by Republican lawmakers.

So we are monitoring bing chat in the same way we measure the regular bing search engine.\n> \u00a0\n> From this data we can see from the statcounter network of webites, that the amount of traffic being sent to websites from bing chat is very, very small. Less than 1\/100 of 1 percent.\n> \u00a0\n> So from our data we can say that bing chat is not currently translating into enough clicks to our network of websites to change the search share.\n> \u00a0\n> Of course you are less likely to click on a source website from bing chat than a regular search, as it is intended to give you the answer rather than have you go visiting websites to find the answer. So that needs to be factored in when using our stats for your analysis.\n\nThe fact that some of the most comprehensive measures available are measuring where traffic to sites is originating, while AI advances are producing tools that encapsulate answers without needing to visit other websites, presents a challenge in interpreting market share figures.\n\nAs of December 2024, Statcounter [reported](https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/search-engine-market-share) that Google had a search market share of 89.7%, down from 91.6% in December of 2023.","83":"5 U.S. Code \u00a7 101 - Executive departments | U.S. Code | US Law | LII \/ Legal Information Institute\n\nThere are 15 executive departments, all headed by a Cabinet Secretary nominated by the President and requiring Senate confirmation.

Some of the published proposals are:\n\n* [<u>Proposals from chapter 14 about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)<\/u>](https:\/\/static.project2025.org\/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf) from the[ <u>Project 2025 Policy Agenda<\/u>](https:\/\/www.project2025.org\/policy\/)\n* The Republican Study Committee's[ <u>FY 2025 Budget Proposal<\/u>](https:\/\/hern.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87)\n* A[ <u>2023 opinion piece<\/u>](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/4-ways-repeal-obamacare) by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n* A[ <u>paper from the Paragon Health Institute<\/u>](https:\/\/paragoninstitute.org\/private-health\/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud\/), a health policy research institute run by[ <u>Brian Blase<\/u>](https:\/\/paragoninstitute.org\/profile\/brian-blase\/), former economic policy advisor during Trump's first term\n\nThe ACA is lengthy and complex, but the Republican proposals generally focus on a few key aspects, described below alongside other potential targets:\n\n* **Reducing Medicaid eligibility and expenses:** The ACA expanded federal Medicaid eligibility to households with income of 133% of the federal poverty line or less ([<u>see ACA Section 2001<\/u>](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/111\/plaws\/publ148\/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), effectively this threshold is [<u>138%<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/medicaid-chip\/medicaid-expansion-and-you\/) after accounting for other income adjustments in the law). However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius<\/u>*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthinsurance.org\/glossary\/individual-mandate\/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees<\/u>](https:\/\/www.cigna.com\/employers\/insights\/informed-on-reform\/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/shots-health-news\/2024\/11\/21\/nx-s1-5198483\/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting<\/u>](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration<\/u>](https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/how-plans-set-your-premiums\/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee<\/u>](https:\/\/hern.house.gov\/uploadedfiles\/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin<\/u>](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/07\/27\/539907467\/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote).

The standard deduction, which doubled under the TCJA, would be cut in half (with certain inflation adjustments) if the provision were to sunset.\n\nSenate Republicans want to make these TCJA tax cuts permanent, while Democrats generally oppose this citing budget deficit concerns. The Senate's filibuster rules typically require 60 votes for legislation, meaning in a 53-47 chamber, most bills need support from 7 Democrats. Budget reconciliation offers a path around this, allowing passage with a simple majority.\n\nHowever, reconciliation bills that increase the deficit face complications under Senate rules. The traditional approach uses a \"current law baseline,\" which assumes scheduled tax cuts will expire.

Okay, you know English and mathematics, let's say. But we want to move education back to the states. If you look at the states, if you look at some of the individual countries, Norway is a very strong educational country, but many. I think Iowa, and I think Indiana, and a lot of these states that are well-run states. We have a lot of them that are very well run. When they run their own educational program, I think it's going to, I think they'll be able to compete with anybody. Then you're going to have the badly run states, like a guy like Gavin Newscum \\[sic] in California, where he does a poor job, and he'll, but even in California, you'll give it to Riverside.

Also, under credit reform, the credit subsidy cost is recorded as an outlay when a direct or guaranteed loan is disbursed. An outlay is not recorded for repayment of debt principal, disbursements to the public by federal credit programs for direct loan obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 1992 or later, disbursements from deposit funds, and refunds of receipts that result from overpayments. Outlays during a fiscal year may be for payment of obligations incurred in prior years (prior-year obligations) or in the same year.

While it provides a framework for the upcoming fiscal year, it does not become law and does not require the president\u2019s signature. Importantly, the budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions, which direct specific congressional committees to draft legislation that meets the resolution\u2019s fiscal goals. These instructions are optional but allow for the creation of a [reconciliation bill](https:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation), which allows the Senate to pass certain budget-related laws with a simple majority vote and limited debate, bypassing the [filibuster](https:\/\/www.senate.gov\/about\/powers-procedures\/filibusters-cloture.htm).\n\nIf reconciliation instructions are included, the resulting reconciliation bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the president to become law.

An official representative must be clearly speaking on behalf of the company.\n* A public claim or statement of opinion by lab leadership that they have developed an AI system that they consider to be AGI will also be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. Lab leadership will be considered to be the chief executive of each organization, or equivalent, or their nearest equivalent successor in the event they depart the company or eliminate the CEO position.

For example, a CEO stating their belief that the organization has created AGI would resolve the question as **Yes**, including in informal settings such as podcast appearances, interviews, or X.com. Statements that do not clearly attribute a position to the organization or CEO are not sufficient. For example, if a CEO were to say \"I think that the AI system we have developed would satisfy some definitions of AGI\" that would **not** be sufficient, because it does not clearly state a belief in having developed AGI under a definition they hold, only that they believe it satisfies definitions of AGI that others hold.\n* There are no requirements on the AI system that is referred to as AGI, there need not be public details, access, or announcements about such a system. However, a statement must refer to a system that the lab claims it has developed. A statement such as \"We are currently developing AGI\" or \"We are currently training AGI\" is not sufficient. Claims will generally be taken at face value, for example a claim that AGI has been developed will be sufficient, even if there is evidence to the contrary indicating that the system has not been completed.\n* Metaculus will assess potentially qualifying statements and reporting and make a determination as to whether the criteria were satisfied.
