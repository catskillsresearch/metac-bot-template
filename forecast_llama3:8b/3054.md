Based on the rationales provided in each forecast, I will combine them to create a new original rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale.

Rationale:

The time left until the outcome to the question is unknown, as it is a future event. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is varied across different countries and regions, with some having shorter working hours and others longer. If the current trend continued, there could be an increase in working hours due to technological advancements, globalization, and changing workforce demographics.

Experts are divided on the issue, with some predicting a shift towards shorter working hours and others expecting longer hours. Markets don't have a direct influence on working hours, but they can impact the overall economy and productivity, which in turn could affect working hours.

Unexpected scenarios that could result in a low outcome include changes in societal values and work-life balance demands, leading to reduced working hours, or widespread adoption of automation and AI technologies, resulting in job losses and decreased working hours. On the other hand, unexpected scenarios that could lead to a high outcome include breakthroughs in artificial intelligence or automation, revolutionizing industries and justifying longer working hours.

Final Prediction:

Percentile 10: 35
Percentile 20: 37
Percentile 40: 42
Percentile 60: 45
Percentile 80: 48
Percentile 90: 52

Note: This forecast is based on the combined rationales from the individual forecasts and does not represent any specific original forecast.
