Based on the rationales provided in the five forecasts, here is a new original rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 25 years, considering the current trends and data available up to 2025-06-18.

**(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** If current trends continue, it's likely that obesity rates will rise globally, with more than half of adults worldwide affected by obesity or overweight by 2030. The exact percentage might vary depending on the country and region, but it's expected to be higher in some areas.

**(c) Current trend continued:** Assuming the current trend continues, we can expect an even more rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity worldwide. This could lead to a staggering 70-75% of adults affected by obesity or overweight by 2030 (around 243-274 million people).

**(d) Expectations of experts and markets:** Experts warn that over 60% of the world's population may be obese or overweight by 2030, with some countries experiencing higher growth rates than others. Markets are likely to respond to this trend, leading to increased demand for healthy food options and a rise in the obesity treatment industry.

**(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome:** An unexpected global shift towards plant-based diets and increased emphasis on sustainable living could lead to a lower obesity rate than predicted. Governments and corporations invest heavily in promoting environmentally friendly food choices, and the world sees a significant decline in obesity-related health issues.

**(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome:** A sudden surge in fast-food chain expansion and marketing efforts targeting vulnerable demographics (e.g., children, low-income communities) could lead to an even higher obesity rate than predicted. The proliferation of unhealthy food options contributes to increased rates of obesity worldwide.

**Final Probability:**

Percentile 10: 65.5
Percentile 20: 67.2
Percentile 40: 71.1
Percentile 60: 74.3
Percentile 80: 78.5
Percentile 90: 82.9

This combined rationale incorporates the best of each individual forecast, including the time left until the outcome is known, the expected status quo outcome if nothing changed, and the potential for unexpected scenarios that could result in a low or high outcome.
