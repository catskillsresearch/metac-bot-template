Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

**Consistent Rationale**

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is uncertain, as it depends on various factors such as market conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory decisions. The status quo outcome if nothing changed would likely result in continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin, potentially leading to higher prices.

If the current trend continues, with increasing institutional investment and potential interest from nation-states looking to diversify their reserves, the price of Bitcoin could reach new heights. Experts' expectations vary, but many predict that Bitcoin could reach $1 million or even higher by 2030 due to its superior characteristics as a digital store of value.

However, unexpected scenarios could result in lower outcomes, such as significant regulatory crackdowns or environmental concerns leading to decreased adoption and a subsequent drop in value. On the other hand, unforeseen events like rapid institutional adoption or advancements in blockchain technology could drive up demand and push the price even higher.
