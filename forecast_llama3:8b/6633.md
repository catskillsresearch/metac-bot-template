Here is a combined rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The time left until humanity's descendants meet grabby aliens is approximately 10-15 years, considering the current pace of astrobiology and exoplanet research. If nothing changes, the status quo outcome would be that humanity may not find definitive clues of alien life in the next 20 years, due to ongoing challenges and limitations in SETI research. However, if the current trend continues, with advancements in rock and soil sampling from Mars and exoplanet research, there might be some tantalizing hints or discoveries within the next 10-15 years.

Experts like Abel MÃ©ndez predict that humanity may find clues of alien life in the next 20 years, while markets seem to have a general optimism about the potential for extraterrestrial discoveries. An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome is if humanity's priorities shift significantly towards addressing pressing global issues like climate change, poverty, or pandemics, leading to a temporary delay or redirection of resources dedicated to SETI research.

On the other hand, an unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is the discovery of a highly advanced alien civilization that has been monitoring Earth for centuries. This could lead to a rapid acceleration of technological advancements and new possibilities for interstellar communication.

Considering these factors, I forecast:
