Here is a new original rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The number of nuclear weapons will continue to fluctuate based on various factors such as international tensions, diplomatic efforts, and technological advancements. North Korea's nuclear arsenal is likely to grow, potentially reaching 300 warheads by 2035, while China's arsenal may reach around 1000-1500 warheads by the same time. The United States and Russia are expected to continue modernizing their arsenals.

If current trends continue, the number of nuclear weapons globally will increase due to ongoing tensions between nations and the desire to maintain or enhance existing military capabilities. This could result in a slight increase in production over the next 5-10 years.

However, unexpected scenarios can also impact the outcome. A sudden diplomatic breakthrough or a change in government priorities could lead to significant reductions in nuclear arsenals worldwide. On the other hand, a global crisis or an economic collapse could accelerate the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons.

Considering these factors, I predict that the number of nuclear weapons will reach:
