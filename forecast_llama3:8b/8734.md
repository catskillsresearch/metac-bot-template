Here is a consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US by 2027 can be expected to continue its current growth trend, driven by increasing consumer demand, declining battery costs, and expanding charging infrastructure. The International Energy Agency predicts that most new cars sold will be electric by 2030, indicating a significant acceleration in adoption rates. If current trends continue, we might see an estimated 30-35% of new car sales being electric vehicles (EVs) by 2027.

However, there are some potential factors that could influence this outcome. For instance, sudden and significant increases in oil prices or economic downturns could lead to decreased consumer demand for EVs. On the other hand, breakthroughs in battery technology, government incentives, or regulatory changes could accelerate adoption rates, potentially resulting in an estimated 40-50% of new car sales being EVs by 2027.

Considering these factors, a consistent rationale can be developed:

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: As of June 18th, 2025, we have approximately 2 years remaining until the outcome to this question becomes known, assuming it refers to 2027.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: If current trends continue, I expect around 25-30% of new car sales in 2027 to be electric vehicles (EVs), based on current growth rates and market penetration.

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: Assuming the current trend continues, I forecast that around 35-40% of new car sales will be EVs by 2027. This is slightly higher than the status quo outcome due to the expected acceleration of electric vehicle adoption.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: Various sources, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), predict that most new cars sold in 2030 or earlier will be electric vehicles. The market is also trending towards increased adoption of EVs, driven by government incentives, declining battery costs, and growing consumer demand.

(e) Unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome: An unexpected scenario that could result in a lower outcome (e.g., around 15%) might involve significant delays or setbacks in the development of charging infrastructure, leading to concerns about range anxiety and reduced demand for EVs. This could be exacerbated by regulatory changes or trade policies affecting global supply chains.

(f) Unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome: An unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome (e.g., around 50%) might involve breakthroughs in battery technology, making electric vehicles even more appealing to consumers and leading to accelerated adoption rates. This could be driven by innovations in materials science, manufacturing processes, or government incentives.
