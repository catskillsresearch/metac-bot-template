After combining the rationales, I have developed a new original rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale:

The highest level of annual GDP growth in the US before 2030 will be influenced by various factors, including current trends and their continuation or deviation. The status quo outcome if nothing changes would likely result in slowing economic growth due to debt accumulation, declining birth rates, and potential changes in government policies. However, unexpected scenarios could significantly impact these predictions.

On one hand, an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome is the emergence of a new technology or innovation that revolutionizes industries, leading to accelerated growth, reduced debt, and increased competitiveness (e.g., AI-powered automation). On the other hand, another unexpected scenario that could result in a high outcome is significant policy shifts, such as widespread adoption of carbon pricing or ambitious climate initiatives, driving economic growth through green investments.

The expectations of experts and markets reflect these uncertainties, with some anticipating a slowdown in economic growth and others expecting continued growth despite challenges. Markets tend to be cautious in their expectations, taking into account potential risks and uncertainties.

Considering these factors, I forecast that the highest level of annual GDP growth in the US before 2030 will be:
