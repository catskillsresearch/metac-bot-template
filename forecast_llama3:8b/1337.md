Here is a new, original rationale that combines the best of each individual rationale:

The average rate of formation of suitable stars (stars/year) in our galaxy can be influenced by various factors such as star formation rates, metallicity, and galactic evolution. A consistent trend observed across different galaxies and time scales suggests that star formation rates have been relatively constant over billions of years.

However, there is evidence to suggest that the rate of star formation has varied throughout the history of our galaxy. For instance, observations of young star clusters and supernova remnants imply that star formation was more intense in the distant past.

Considering these factors, we can develop a rationale that incorporates the best of each individual perspective:

A consistent trend in star formation rates, observed across different galaxies and time scales, suggests that the average rate of formation of suitable stars (stars/year) in our galaxy is approximately 1-2 stars per year. However, variations in metallicity and galactic evolution could lead to fluctuations in this rate over time.

Taking into account the unexpected scenarios presented by Forecast 3, we can adjust our prediction accordingly:

**Final answer:**

Percentile 10: 0.6
Percentile 20: 0.7
Percentile 40: 1.2
Percentile 60: 1.8
Percentile 80: 2.4
Percentile 90: 3.2

This forecast reflects a moderate confidence level, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the question.
