**Description**: On June 13, 2025, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) [struck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran) several targets in Iran, including the private residences of several of Iran's top leaders. In the wake of the strikes, rumors arose that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had [been killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-is-alive-security-source-tells-reuters-2025-06-13/) or had [fled the country](https://x.com/The_Real_ITDUDE/status/1933923628904853857?t=zLFB8cSLHXaZRi_SmcuzyA\&s=19).

**Resolution Criteria**: This question will resolve as **Yes** if, after June 14, 2025 and before July 14, 2025, Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei makes a public appearance within the geographic territory of Iran, according to <u>c</u>[<u>redible source</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting.

If this has not occurred during the period in question, then this question will resolve as **No**. It will additionally resolve as **No** if Khamenei dies or permanently resigns from the position of Supreme Leader before July 14, 2025.
**Fine Print**: A public appearance is defined as Khamenei presenting himself in front of an audience.

A television address would count, as long as it is credibly reported that Khamenei has made the address from within Iran. It would count even if it was pre-recorded, as long as there is credible evidence that it was recorded from within Iran in the relevant time period.
