The rationales from the five forecasts indicate a wide range of opinions regarding the percentage of new vehicle production that will be electric in the US by 2027. Taking into account each rationale, we can synthesize a comprehensive view:

A combined analysis of these forecasts reveals an optimistic outlook for electric vehicles (EVs) in the US market by 2027. Most predictions suggest that EVs could make up between 30% to 50% of new car sales, with some experts projecting higher figures close to or exceeding 60%. This wide range can be attributed to several factors:

1. Continued Technological Advancements: Rapid improvements in battery technology are expected to reduce costs and enhance performance, making EVs more attractive to consumers.
2. Government Policies: Incentives for EV adoption, such as tax credits or subsidies, could further boost demand and market share.
3. Infrastructure Development: Expansion of charging stations across the US would improve consumer confidence in EVs and facilitate wider adoption.
4. Market Competition: As more traditional automakers invest heavily in EV development and production, competition is expected to intensify, leading to better options for consumers.
5. Environmental Concerns: Growing global awareness of climate change and dependence on fossil fuels could accelerate consumer shift towards cleaner transportation solutions like EVs.

Unexpected scenarios that might affect these projections include both positive (e.g., unanticipated breakthroughs in battery technology leading to a more significant reduction in EV costs) and negative (e.g., an economic downturn causing reduced consumer spending, or rapid advancements in ICE technology rendering EVs less attractive).

Considering all these elements, the probabilistic assessment for the percentage of new vehicle production being electric in the US by 2027 can be inferred as follows:
- Probability of <15%: Low (10%) - Unforeseen global economic downturn or significant technological breakthroughs favoring ICE vehicles.
- Probability of 15-30%: Medium (40%) - Current growth trend is maintained, with no major disruptions or breakthroughs.
- Probability of 30-40%: High (60%) - Continued technological advancements and supportive government policies are expected to drive EV adoption above current levels.
- Probability of >40%: Very High (85%) - Accelerated battery innovations, stringent environmental regulations, and robust market competition may push the EV market share beyond 40%.

In summary, while uncertainties exist, a bullish outlook suggests that electric vehicle production could account for between 30% to 60% of new car sales in the US by 2027.
