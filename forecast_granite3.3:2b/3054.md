In the foreseen timeline of 2030, considering the various scenarios and rationales provided by different forecasts, the average American employee is expected to work around 40 hours per week. This prediction is grounded in the ongoing global trend towards reducing working hours without compromising productivity or living standards, driven by technological advancements like automation, AI, and robotics. Experts predict that these technologies will facilitate a shift towards shorter workweeks, aligning more closely with the OECD average of 37.6 hours per week.

However, it's essential to acknowledge potential unexpected scenarios:

1. An unanticipated global economic downturn could cause corporations to increase working hours instead of decreasing them to maintain profitability and compensate for reduced workforce or lower consumer demand.
2. A rapid shift towards a universal basic income (UBI) model might diminish the need for individuals to work long hours to meet their basic needs, resulting in decreased working hours across various sectors and industries.
3. If labor laws were significantly reformed or there was a global economic downturn leading to job security concerns, workers might accept lower hours or salaries due to reduced demand for goods and services.
4. A technological breakthrough enabling increased productivity without extending working hours could allow companies to maintain efficiency while implementing longer workweeks, especially in sectors with high automation potential.

Therefore, the rationale behind this forecast acknowledges the current trend of reducing working hours, yet it remains cautious regarding unpredictable factors like economic crises and rapid technological advancements that could shift these dynamics in either direction.
