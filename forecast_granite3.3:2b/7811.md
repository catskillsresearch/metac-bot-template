The nuclear weapons count could potentially range from a low of approximately 5 trillion warheads to a high exceeding 10 million, based on current trends and expert projections. However, it's essential to consider the inherent uncertainty due to unknown unknowns, with a wide confidence interval reflecting this unpredictability. Factors such as geopolitical tensions, technological advancements, international disarmament efforts, and global power shifts can significantly influence these projections.

Final Rationale: The number of nuclear weapons detonated offensively by 2050 could span a broad spectrum from millions to trillions, depending on various factors such as continued arms races, the emergence of new nuclear states, technological breakthroughs, disarmament efforts, and global power dynamics. The inherent unpredictability due to unknown unknowns implies that these estimates are highly probabilistic, with a wide range of potential outcomes reflecting this uncertainty.
