Final Rationale:
95% of the world population may be obese or overweight by 2030, with a potential range from 60% to 95%, based on current trends and expert predictions. This prediction assumes continued growth in obesity rates due to factors like unhealthy lifestyles, sedentary habits, and poor dietary choices. However, an unexpected global public health initiative promoting significant improvements in nutrition, exercise, and healthy eating could potentially lower the obesity rate below these projections. Conversely, a hypothetical pandemic with individuals focusing on combating the disease at the expense of their health might drastically increase obesity rates, pushing the prediction towards the higher end of this range (95%).
