Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of China meeting its key climate target in 2030. Let me start by summarizing what I know about China's carbon emissions and targets.

First, China aims to reduce carbon intensity by 18% over five years (from 2020-2025). As of recent data, it has decreased its carbon intensity by -3.9% since 2005, which is closer than previously thought. The government also wants to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 and aim for full climate action by 2060.

Looking at the sources provided:
- The News International reports that China's clean-energy sectors contributed a significant portion of GDP growth in 2024, accounting for 13.6tn yuan ($1.9tn) worth of clean energy.
- They mention overcapacity and weak profitability issues affecting profitability but suggest ongoing support through economic stimulus measures.

The analysis notes that despite these challenges, China is likely to meet or exceed the target due to strong current efforts in renewable energy and ongoing investment growth in clean energy sectors. The focus on green tech with potential long-term sustainability seems promising.

In a brief scenario, if there's weak profitability, oversupply, and public willingness, China might not meet the targetâ€”resulting in a "No" outcome. However, considering current progress and ongoing efforts, it leans towards meeting or exceeding the target.

Therefore, the probability of meeting China's key climate target by 2030 is high but uncertain due to ongoing challenges like weak profitability and oversupply.
