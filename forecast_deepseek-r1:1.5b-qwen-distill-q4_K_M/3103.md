Okay, let me try to figure out how beef prices are going to change from January 2024 to June 2025 based on the information given. 

First, I see that beef consumption is down, which might mean prices aren't rising as much. But there's some government support programs like the C counting DNI, where you can get a discount on meat purchases. That could offset part of the price increase.

Looking at the statistics, from January 2023 to April 2024, beef prices went up by about 7%. So, over two years, that's an average increase of 3.5% per year. If this continues without any changes, the expected increase would be around 6.5% in June 2025.

However, government promotions and market trends suggest there might be a slight bump due to consumption decreasing but government incentives. So, maybe the price could go up by about 14%.

In summary, based on current data and trends, I expect beef prices to increase slightly from 2024 to 2025 with potential small adjustments.
