Alright, I need to figure out the GDP for India in 2025 based on the expert mid-term expectations provided earlier. The user gave me some data from different sources, including Morgan Stanley's forecast and the IMF's data. 

First, let me recall that a credible scenario is when no information is given, and all expert opinions are considered. In this case, there isn't an indication of when the final answer will be known, so I can’t provide specific dates. However, I can structure my analysis based on the experts' mid-term expectations.

Starting with part (a), since I don’t have a specific date for when the forecast data will become available, I won’t assign any time left to the outcome as it’s unclear.

Moving on to part (b), if nothing changes, the GDP in 2025 is expected to be $4.3 trillion. This aligns with the IMF's quick growth projection and Morgan Stanley's scenario where India would surpass Germany by third place.

Part (c) asks about the outcome if current trend continues. From Morgan Stanley’s forecast, this should result in a GDP of $5.7 trillion with India overtaking Germany as second place.

For part (d), which deals with expert expectations and market reactions, it's important to note that while they expect continued growth, there are risks like external factors such as economic policy changes or trade issues that could impact the GDP.

Finally, part (e) is about an unexpected low outcome. A possible scenario here is a global economic downturn affecting India’s exports or investments. For example, if the US policy becomes stricter or China faces a trade deficit, it might slow down growth and result in a lower GDP.

Lastly, part (f) covers a high outcome scenario with expert reactions. An unexpected increase in consumption due to government policies like tax cuts or expanded consumer spending could boost GDPP significantly.

In summary, while I don’t have specific dates for each outcome, the mid-term expectations from experts provide a structured approach to understanding India's likely GDP trends in 2025.
