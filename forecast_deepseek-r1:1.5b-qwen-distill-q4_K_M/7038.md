Okay, so I'm trying to understand this task. The user has given me several forecasted values for different countries and regions from June 26, 2023, until May 7, 2050. Each country provided one value, but without an interval or confidence range, it's a bit confusing. 

Each entry seems to start at a specific date in June 2023 with a certain number of metric tons/year and ends by May 2050. If I take these as points rather than intervals, I can only create one value per country but not multiple percentiles. This makes it difficult to provide six distinct percentile values because each forecast is just one point.

However, if the user expects me to extrapolate or assume a steady growth rate over those years beyond June 2023 and before May 2050, that would be another approach. But without additional data, I can't make confident assumptions about future trends based on past data alone.

In summary, each forecast starts at June 26, 2023, with a specific value, and ends by May 7, 2050. This suggests that the user expects me to create six distinct values within this timeframe but hasn't provided enough context or data points for interval forecasting methods.
