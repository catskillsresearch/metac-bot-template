Okay, so I need to explain how my thought process would flow when considering each forecast's rationale based on the user's instructions. Each forecast has four parts: time left for an outcome, status quo scenario, no outcome scenario, and yes outcome scenario.

Starting with Forecast 1, it seems like a straightforward scenario where the status quo is "No" because it's too disruptive to handle. I would explain that this is one of the few scenarios without any analysis or predictions, so it's just a fact-based prediction.

For Forecast 2, which has more detailed information, I would break down each part based on the data provided. I would mention the IMF's growth numbers and the expert opinions about U.S. competitiveness and tech advancements.

Next, Forecast 3 is a bit more structured but still very straightforward. It breaks down into time left, status quo, no outcome, and yes scenario, each with specific reasons for their outcomes. I would explain why each factor supports a particular outcome.

Finally, Forecast 4 is even more detailed, providing clear reasoning for each of the four parts. I would elaborate on each aspect, ensuring that each section is concise yet informative about how that forecast is structured.

I think I've covered all the points and provided a coherent rationale based on the user's instructions.

Probability: 25%

---

#### (a) Time left until the outcome  
Assuming today is June 18, 2023, there are approximately **2 days** remaining for any outcome. This short time frame allows for quick adjustments to global economic dynamics.

---

#### (b) Status quo scenario  
If nothing changes, India's GDP would continue to grow at its historical pace or decline slightly due to external factors like energy prices or political instability. This aligns with the IMF's prediction of 105% growth over the last decade.

---

#### (c) A brief description of a scenario that results in No outcome  
A scenario where India doubles its GDP might not occur if there is a significant decline in key factors contributing to rapid GDP growth, such as energy prices or political instability. This could disrupt supply chains and reduce growth momentum.

---

#### (d) A brief description of a scenario that results in Yes outcome  
If factors contributing to India's rapid GDP growth continue, the economy can double its GDP. Factors like technology advancements, renewable energy adoption, and government support would sustain growth despite external disruptions.
