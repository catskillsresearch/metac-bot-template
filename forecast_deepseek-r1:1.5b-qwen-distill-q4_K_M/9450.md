### Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:

**1. Understanding the Forecasting Criteria**

The user provided a set of statements and data about U.S. nuclear energy, including reactor capacities, growth rates, and market trends. The goal is to predict percentages for each outcome with confidence intervals.

2. **Current Trend Continuation:**
   - The U.S. has 411 nuclear reactors generating around 371 GW.
   - By 2050, it aims for 5 GW through new or expanded plants.
   - This assumes the current rate continues without external interruptions.

3. **Status quo Outcome:**
   - Without changes from now to 2025:
     - Reactor operations remain at 411 plants with 371 GW.
     - Energy demand remains stable as market prices are likely unaffected.

4. **Expert Expectations and Markets:**
   - Experts might predict a moderate increase of 4-6 GW by 2050.
   - Current demand or pricing factors influence this expectation.

5. **Low Outcome Scenario:**
   - Unlikely, but possible if there's a recessionary economic downturn impacting energy demand.
   - This would result in lower nuclear plant operations and possibly less new capacity.

6. **High Outcome Scenario:**
   - Unlikely unless external factors like oil price increases or new technologies come online.
   - This would result in higher nuclear power generation due to these factors.

7. **Final Predictions with Confidence Intervals:**

- **48%:** Low outcome (recession or economic downturn affecting demand).
- **53%:** Moderate increase (current demand stable but rising prices lower costs).
- **56%:** Expected outcome (continuation of current trends and market stability).
- **62%:** Higher than expected (increased energy prices or new technologies).
- **70%:** High expectation (rising oil prices or technological advancements).
- **81%:** Maximum confidence (considering all potential factors).
