Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the final answer. The user provided a detailed analysis of the likelihood of changing social media platforms and asked for a rationale that incorporates all parts (a) through (d). 

Starting with part (a), I considered the time left until the outcome is known as 12 hours, which seems reasonable given the context of social media trends changing rapidly. This gives some timeframe to gather information before making a decision.

For part (b), if nothing changes, it would mean TikTok remains dominant, which aligns with the idea that there's no new competitor or trend emerging yet.

In part (c), I thought about scenarios where switching leads to No outcome, such as competitors taking over completely. This is relevant because it reflects potential competition from other platforms.

Finally, for part (d), a Yes scenario would involve switching because competitive brands like Instagram Reels and others gain traction too quickly. However, given the slower trend of social media changes, this shouldn't be too high.

Overall, I concluded that considering trends change slowly and forecasting weight on status quo, the probability is moderate, fitting around 75%. This reflects awareness of competitors rising while prioritizing what's working.
