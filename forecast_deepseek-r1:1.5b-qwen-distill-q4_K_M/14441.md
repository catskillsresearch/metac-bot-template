Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of Russia becoming a lithium powerhouse by 2030. The user provided some detailed information about their current state and plans. Let me break this down step by step.

First, from what I know, Russia's natural resources ministry is stating that they plan to produce at least 60,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate by 2030. This aligns with the government's goal of reducing dependence on imported lithium and boosting high-capacity battery production.

They've already issued permits for three major lithium mines: Kolmozerskoye, Polmostundrovskoye, and Tastygskoye. These are expected to begin operational by 2030. This suggests a strong foundation for their production plans.

Looking at the reserves, Russia has an estimated 1 million tons of lithium and over 3.5 million tons of lithium oxide. The country's lithium oxide reserves alone make up about 14%, indicating potential for global demand. This is significant because EVs are becoming more prevalent globally, especially in China and Europe.

Another factor to consider is the U.S. government's role. They might support Russian mining efforts through policies or agreements. Additionally, Russia has strong economic ties with the U.S., which could facilitate easier access to lithium resources.

Given all these points, I'm leaning towards a "Yes" outcomeâ€”Russia is likely to achieve this goal by 2030.

**Probability: 95%**

Given the substantial reserves, government support, and alignment with global EV trends, it is highly likely that Russia will achieve its goal of producing at least 60,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate by 2030.

**Probability: 95%**
