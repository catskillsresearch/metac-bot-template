Okay, let's break down how I arrived at the final answer for this question.

(a) The time left until the outcome is known (June 26, 2025).

(b) The status quo remains unchanged.

(c) A scenario resulting in a No outcome would require carbon emissions to exceed current records without significant CO2 concentration increases. However, this is unlikely given the rapid human activity impacting CO2 levels and current temperature trends.

(d) A Yes outcome would occur if global warming trends remain below 1.5Â°C even as CO2 concentrations are at record highs. This scenario implies that while we meet the threshold on CO2, economic impacts suggest significant climate change effects.

### Probability: 85%
