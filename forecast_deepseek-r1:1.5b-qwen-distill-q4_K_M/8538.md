Alright, I need to understand how to approach this question step by step. The user provided several sources with different percentages for the outcome if nothing changes in a market analysis about electric vehicles in the U.S.

First, I should interpret what each option is asking for. Part (a) mentions the time left until the outcome can be known but doesn't provide specific data, so it's about forecasting. Part (b) states "if nothing changes," which means I need to use current market numbers from a source.

Part (c) says "if the trend continues." So using the latest data from 2024 with 1.2 million EVs sold and an expected growth of another 5% by 2030, I can calculate that as approximately 14%.

Part (d) talks about experts' expectations versus market trends. It's asking for a balanced view between what the experts predict and the actual market performance.

Part (e) is an unexpected scenario where vehicle prices fall due to high interest rates, leading fewer people to buy EVs despite their growth. This will result in lower demand, so I need to adjust my prediction downward by 3% per year for six years, resulting in a total of 16%.

Lastly, part (f) with higher hybrid adoption could push it up to 21%. 

Now, putting it all together:

Percentile 10: 18.5  
Percentile 20: 17  
Percentile 40: 18.5  
Percentile 60: 19.3  
Percentile 80: 19.5  
Percentile 90: 20.6

This structure ensures each part is addressed with the appropriate percentage based on expert analysis and market trends.
