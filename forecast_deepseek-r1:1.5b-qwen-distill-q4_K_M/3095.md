Alright, let's break down how to create these market forecasts. First, I need to understand the current status quo of the plant-based meat market in the U.S., specifically focusing on price per kilogram and market share.

The study provides that Beyond Meat (BMP) is leading with 40% of the market, Impossible Foods (IO) follows with around 12%, Nestlé has a decent 9%, and other players like Cheapsketch have about 3%. The overall market size is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.74% from 2025 to 2031.

Next, the current price per kilogram for frozen plant-based meat in 2032 is $14.65 USD, which includes all costs. This suggests that BMP is expected to make a significant share of the market based on their market share divided by total size.

The user wants three key scenarios:

1. **Current trend continues**: Projected CAGR of 25.1% from 2025 to 2032, compounded annually.
2. **Status quo (nothing changes)**: Lower growth rate reflecting changes in consumer preferences and costs.
3. **Unexpected scenarios**: Possible increases or decreases due to health consciousness or supply chain issues.

Each scenario should show how the market size and share evolve over each year until 2031. The expert's expectations are around a CAGR of 14.9%, which should align with the current growth rate, reflecting changing trends rather than long-term projections.

By presenting these scenarios with specific percentages for each year, stakeholders can understand how much the market could grow under different conditions.
