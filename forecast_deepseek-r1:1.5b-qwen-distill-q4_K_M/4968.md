Okay, so I'm trying to understand the income inequality trends for China, Japan, and South Korea in 2025 based on various reports and data provided. Let me go through each country one by one.

Starting with China: From the World Bank report, it says that China's public revenues are lagging behind those of upper-middle-income and high-income countries. They recommend making the personal income tax (PIT) more progressive and tackling inequality at the top. The study estimates that lowering taxable income thresholds and applying higher rates at the upper income brackets could increase CIT by up to RM2.8 billion in 2024. However, China is expected to become a high-income country by 2028-2030, but less than half of its people are projected to have incomes above the HIC cut-off due to inequality.

Next, Japan: The report mentions that Japan's Gini coefficient fell from 45 in 2004 to 40 by 2014 and remained at that level through 2019. It also notes that the trend is still stalled in recent years, with income inequality declining slightly to 39 in 2022. The report suggests that while this isn't insignificant, Japan's Gini remains higher than that seen for advanced economies.

Lastly, South Korea: From SingStat, the median household income from work in 2024 grew by 3.9% compared to 2023. The Gini coefficient fell to 0.364 in 2024, which is the lowest level since 2000. Households across most income deciles saw increases in average household income from work per household member after adjusting for inflation.

So, compiling this information into a table with each country's key metrics on inequality would be helpful.

| Country      | Inequality Metrics |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **China**    | Public revenues lag behind advanced economies. recommend progressive CIT. Expected to become high-income by 2028-2030. Less than half of people have incomes above HIC due to inequality. CIT increases up to RM2.8 billion in 2024. |
| **Japan**    | Gini coefficient falls from 45 (2004) to 40 by 2014, remains at that level until 2019, then slightly declines to 39 in 2022. Income inequality declining but not significant. |
| **South Korea** | Median household income growth of +3.9% in 2024. Gini coefficient down to 0.364 (2024), with most deciles seeing increases in average income. |
