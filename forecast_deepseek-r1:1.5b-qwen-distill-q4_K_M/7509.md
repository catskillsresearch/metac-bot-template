Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to this query about Bitcoin's future. The user provided a detailed outline, so let me break it down step by step.

First, understanding what "Good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo" means. They believe that even if nothing changes, the current trend will continue because most of the world's change is gradual. So, I should assume this trend unless there are signs of a shift or decline.

Now, for each part:

(a) Time left until outcome: Since today is June 26, 2025, and the future projection is about 2030, only a few years remain to see if adoption slows down or other issues occur.

(b) Status quo outcome: This would be where Bitcoin continues to grow at its current rate. It's the assumption unless there's evidence of a significant change or regulatory issues.

(c) No outcome scenario: This is when adoption doesn't slow down, and the government faces major issues with regulations against Bitcoin, leading to a decline in adoption despite existing momentum.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Here, adoption continues at a faster rate than mobile phones but not as fast as Bitcoin's growth. Even though there might be some slower adoption due to regulatory hurdles, it's still considered favorable because the overall trend is maintained over time.

I should explain each part clearly, using simple language since it's a general response for someone who may not be familiar with all these terms. Keeping it concise and focusing on the user's format instructions.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.  
If no changes occur, Bitcoin will continue to grow at its current rate, staying in the leader position due to the competitive nature of the tech industry and consumer demand.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a "No" outcome.  
A No outcome would result from significant slow-downs or regulatory issues impacting Bitcoin's growth despite existing momentum. Accepting this could mean adoption stalls, leading to a decline even though Bitcoin continues to grow at a favorable rate.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome.  
A Yes outcome is if Bitcoin maintains its current rate of growth with continued adoption at a higher pace than mobile devices but not as fast as other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. While there may be some slower adoption due to regulations, the overall trend remains favorable.

I write my rationale by assuming no significant changes occur, maintaining Bitcoin's competitive growth trajectory.
