Alright, so I need to figure out how confident I can be about whether inflation will rise after the U.S. increases tariffs on imported goods. Let me break this down step by step.

First, there's a mention of the U.S. debt burden exceeding World War II levels. The Congressional Budget Office has been making warnings about this, but it's not clear if that directly affects interest rates or whether it's just a warning to caution against increased debt. I'm not sure how this ties in with recession probabilities yet.

Next, there's the U.S. GDP growth rate. It was mentioned earlier that growth is expected to be less rapid than before due to lower immigration and slower population growth. If the economy isn't expanding as quickly, that could indicate a recession by the time we get to 2025. But I'm not sure how much of an impact this has on the overall recession probability.

The Fed Chair, President Trump, is upping tax cuts for businesses and households. His move might help reduce consumer spending, which could cool down the economy. However, if other factors like inflation or reduced income taxes are still affecting prices, that could counterbalance some of that cut. So this is a mixed bag—some positive effects, but others might be negative.

Inflation is also on the table. The 10-year breakeven rate reaching a 16-month peak suggests that consumer prices are rising faster than before. If inflation remains high for an extended period, it could push inflation up beyond target levels. But again, if other factors like monetary tightening slow down spending, maybe inflation won't spike as quickly.

Looking at the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio in 2025, it's expected to be around 116%, which is higher than current levels and even surpassed during World War II. If this trend continues, maybe the economy can handle that debt better. But I don't see how this directly causes a recession itself.

Other economic factors like U.S.-China trade tensions are affecting prices, with some countries seeing increased inflation. This could mean that while the Fed is trying to stabilize the economy, other parts of the world are responding differently, possibly leading to mixed results.

Inflation targeting 3-4% isn't being met, and the Federal Reserve is considering rate hikes in response. If the Fed doesn't raise rates enough or raises them too much, it could cause inflation to rise higher than targeted levels.

Looking at economic indicators like the unemployment rate: it's expected to stay below 3%, which suggests a strong economy and less room for contraction. The labor market is favorable, which might indicate that the economy isn't contracting as much, supporting the idea of a recession being less likely.

The Fed Chair also mentioned raising U.S.-Canada tariffs on imports, which could influence prices and inflation. These policies aren’t perfect but do have some impact on consumer costs, potentially slowing down price increases.

Considering all these factors together, there are both positive signals and potential drawbacks affecting the economy in different directions. The Fed is trying to contain inflation while addressing trade tensions with China. The U.S. debt situation and population growth trends seem to be contributing factors as well.

Given that good forecasters weigh more on the status quo because the economy changes slowly most of the time, I'd lean towards a 75% chance of recession this year. There are enough variables—economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, potential trade issues—that balance out, making it somewhat unlikely, but not impossible either.

Probability: 75%

In summary, based on all these factors, the probability that inflation will rise after the U.S. increases tariffs on imported goods is 75%. This includes considerations of economic uncertainty, varying impacts from different policies, and the overall stability of the economy despite some mixed signals.
