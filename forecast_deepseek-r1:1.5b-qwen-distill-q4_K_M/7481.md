Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how likely it is for the U.S. stock market to experience a significant single-day decline in 2025 based on certain trends and data from February 21, 2025. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I see that in January of 2025, there was a sharp decline in the S&P 500 by $927 billion, the Nasdaq by 1.7%, and the Dow Jones Composite by 2.3%. The Russell 2000 also saw a significant drop. These declines were attributed to concerns about rising tariffs and persistent inflation.

The key factors contributing to these declines include:
- Rising tariffs from countries like China, Germany, and Russia, which have started affecting industries.
- Persistent high inflation expectations of 3.5%, which can impact consumer spending and business investment.
- The U.S. economic data showing a decrease in home sales (4.9%) and negative MCSI data, indicating cooling consumer sentiment.

The Fed decided to cut interest rates by another 15 basis points to stabilize the market. However, the high inflation and tariffs are still significant concerns.

Considering good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo because changes are usually gradual, I think the stock market is likely to experience this large decline in 2025. The Fed's rate cuts might provide some relief, but given the direct impacts of rising tariffs and persistent inflation, it's more probable that the market continues to fall.

So, summarizing:

- **Time left until outcome**: February 21, 2025, is likely near its own peak before declining further.
- **Status quo if nothing changes**: The market would stay as it is due to gradual policy changes.
- **A No outcome scenario**: With Fed rate cuts and the existing economic challenges of inflation and rising tariffs, a no outcome where the market continues to fall makes sense.
- **A Yes outcome scenario**: If the Fed keeps cutting rates, it might lead to stabilization despite the current issues.

**Probability**: 75%

Wait, but in the example earlier, I thought about the time left until outcome as "1 month left," which fits with February 2026 being one month away from that scenario. 

So, putting it all together:

(a) **Time left until outcome**: The market is likely to decline for 1 month.
(b) **Status quo outcome if nothing changes**: No change expected; the market remains unchanged.
(c) **A No outcome scenario**: Fed cuts rates again, leading to stabilization.
(d) **A Yes outcome scenario**: Inflation expectations rise further, stabilizing the market.

**Rationale**: Good forecasters weight status quo outcomes more due to gradual policy changes in the world.

### Probability: 40%
