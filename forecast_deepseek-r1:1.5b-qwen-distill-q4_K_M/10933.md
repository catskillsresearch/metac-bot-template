**Probability: 60-70%**

In a scenario where SBF faces significant evidence that contradicts his current legal record or behavior, the outcome leans towards "No." New information about non-fraudulent transactions or unexpected behaviors could challenge SBF's status quo. However, existing records suggest he should remain out of prison for 25 years.

**Probability: 40-50%**

In a scenario where there are no new evidence to change the legal record or behavior, the outcome remains uncertain. The court's decision would likely follow the status quo and SBF's current sentence.

**Probability: 30-40%**

In a scenario with a compelling new piece of evidence that directly challenges the status quo and alters his legal record, the "No" outcome is highly probable. This could include increased scrutiny or unexpected behaviors that affect criminal proceedings.
