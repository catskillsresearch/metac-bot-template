Alright, so I need to figure out how to forecast the unemployment rate for 2026 based on various scenarios as provided in the data from 2024 and some other trends. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at Colombia: there are 2.5 million young people neither studying nor working. The majority are women, making up 15.2%, while men make up 84.8%. The unemployment rate for young people in Colombia has increased by 0.1 percentage points to 8.6%, and participation rates have gone from around 54% to 54.8%.

Comparing this with other countries like India, the US, Japan, and the US, it seems that Colombia's young population isn't doing as well as others who have had similar changes over time. However, each country has its own dynamics, so it's hard to generalize beyond these specific data points.

For India: there are about 20 million youth in their workforce. The unemployment rate for these young people is dropping by 14%, moving from around 6% to 3%. The labor force participation rate is increasing slightly, going up by 0.2 percentage points to 54%.

The US has a higher participation rate of 56.8%, but only a 1.7% unemployment rate for the workforce compared to Colombia and India's higher youth unemployment rates.

For Japan: there are over 3 million young people in the labor force with a participation rate increasing by 0.2 percentage points to 54%.

The US is leading here with its high participation rate and low unemployment rates among the working population. Other countries like China have lower participation, but they might still be catching up.

Considering all these factors—the increasing youth unemployment rate in some regions, higher unemployment in young workers overall, and other trends—it seems that even though Colombia has a higher youth unemployment rate than others, the US is leading with strong labor market data among the working population. This makes me think the US might maintain its leadership in terms of labor force participation rates.

### Final Answer:
Percentile 10: 8.6%  
Percentile 20: 7.9%  
Percentile 40: 7.5%  
Percentile 60: 7.3%  
Percentile 80: 7.2%  
Percentile 90: 7.1%

The forecast for the unemployment rate in 2026 is expected to be around 7.3%. The current trend shows a slight decrease, indicating potential improvements but not a complete reversal of past trends. However, other factors such as economic conditions and labor market dynamics could still affect this outcome.
