Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how likely it is for the US stock market to maintain its growth pace in 2025 based on these expert opinions. Let's break down each point step by step.

First, part (a) talks about the time left until prediction is known. The last date was June 26, 2025, so there's no time remaining for any changes to happen. That might mean that while the market tends to follow historical patterns, it could change due to various factors like Trump's policies or global events.

Part (b) says if nothing changes, the market continues its growth as it did last year. The increase was 2.7% in January and historical context suggests that momentum should carry through. So that seems likely but not guaranteed.

Part (c) is about scenarios where the market doesn't maintain growth. That could happen if there are external factors disrupting trends, like a crisis or unexpected policy changes. But I think these are less likely than just minor events.

Part (d) talks about scenarios leading to a Yes outcome, meaning the market maintains its growth pace. This depends on Trump's policies and economic indicators showing steady growth. So even though factors like deregulation are good news, there might be some risks if things don't go perfectly.

Considering all this, I think the market is expected to grow moderately in 2025 because of consistent policies and historical trends. However, external events could cause some uncertainty, but not a complete downturn.

Probability: 75%

This probability considers the market's growth based on recent data, the tendency for slow changes (like Trump's policies), and some potential risks from unexpected factors like external events.
