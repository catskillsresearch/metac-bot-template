Okay, so I need to figure out if China's economy will surpass the US by 2030. The user mentioned some data about China's growth rate and net fixed capital formation in the previous responses. Let me break this down.

First, China's annual growth rate is at 5%, while the US is growing at 2%. That suggests it might outpace them if all factors stay as is. However, I also remember that the US has ongoing trade tensions with China, which could introduce uncertainty and change the outcome.

The previous answer suggested a No outcome due to internal strengths but also mentioned potential shifts from trade dynamics. The current economic trends point towards a tilt toward China's economy rather than outpacing the US.

Considering all factors, I think the No outcome is more likely.

China's economy is expected to **not surpass** the US by 2030. Internal strengths like energy and supply chains suggest it will continue growing despite potential external factors like trade tensions.
