Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the answer step by step.

1. **Understanding the Queries**: The user provided several queries related to Bitcoin's price predictions across different cryptocurrencies and time horizons. They wanted me to predict outcomes for these scenarios without using any currency or commas in the final answers.

2. **Extracting Key Information**: From their data, I noted:
   - By 2023: Bitcoin at $3.
   - 2024: Up to $5 (potentially oscillating).
   - 2025: Value around $6.
   - Ripple's price from $0.46 to $2 in 2021 and up to $5 in 2024.
   - XRP reaching $17 by 2030.

3. **Mapping Time Points**: I focused on the latest data, which was for November 15, 2020. This gave me a stable starting point for mapping future trends and expert predictions.

4. **Estimating Percentiles**: Based on the expected growth paths:
   - If nothing changes (for future trends):
     - 10: 10% chance.
     - 20: 30% chance.
     - 40: 50% chance.
     - 60: 70% chance.
     - 80: 90% chance.
     - 90: 60% chance (since XRP reaches $17 in 2030).
   - If the current trend continued:
     - 10: 10% chance.
     - 20: 30% chance.
     - 40: 50% chance.
     - 60: 70% chance.
     - 80: 90% chance.
     - 90: 60% chance.

5. **Finalizing the Answer**: I structured the answer to match the required format, using clear and concise language without any currency symbols or commas.

By following these steps, I was able to provide a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin's price predictions across different scenarios and time horizons.

Now, let me lay out the answers in a clear format:

Percentile 10: **10.0**  
Percentile 20: **30.0**  
Percentile 40: **50.0**  
Percentile 60: **70.0**  
Percentile 80: **90.0**  
Percentile 90: **60.0**

These percentages represent the estimated likelihood of Bitcoin reaching certain prices within the specified time frames based on expert predictions and trends.
