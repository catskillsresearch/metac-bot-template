Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how likely it is for India's railway system to achieve 100% electrification by 2030 and become a net-zero emitter. First, I know that India has been making significant strides in getting its railways electrified, but I'm not sure about the current situation. From what I remember, they have a massive infrastructure project involving several states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andaman and Sri Nicobar islands.

I think they're planning to buy a lot of renewable energy from other countries like Madhya Pradesh and others. That must be important because getting rid of non-renewable fuel sources is big for reducing emissions. But I also wonder about the costs involved in buying all that power. If it's too expensive, maybe the system might not get fully electrified.

Also, I recall that India is aiming to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030 and beyond, so achieving 100% electrification aligns with their goals. However, getting that far would require a lot of investment in both building new stations and purchasing energy from different sources. Maybe they're on the fence because while it's good for the country, it might take too long or cost too much.

I'm not sure if there are any public or private sector challenges they've overcome, but I think they're doing their part. Plus, with other countries in the loop, maybe they can cover a lot of costs quickly. But without more specific information about current energy prices and investment timelines, it's hard to say for sure.

So, considering all this, I think there's some uncertainty about whether India will achieve 100% electrification on time and scale. It might go Yes because they're making progress, but the speed could be an issue. It might also go No if costs are too high or investment is delayed beyond what's feasible.

Probability: 55%

- **(a) Time left until outcome known:** 2 days (from June 26 to June 28)
  
- **(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changes:** Yes (55%)

- **(c) Scenario resulting in a No outcome:** India might not achieve full electrification by 2030 due to high costs of purchasing renewable energy, insufficient investment in infrastructure, or delayed project timelines that exceed feasibility.

- **(d) Scenario resulting in a Yes outcome:** India likely achieves full electrification on time and scale, aligning with global trends and environmental goals.
