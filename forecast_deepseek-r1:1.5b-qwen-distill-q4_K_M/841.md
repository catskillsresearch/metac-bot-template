Okay, I need to figure out the probability of smartphones being replaced by AR glasses by 2030 based on the given scenarios. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand each part of the question:

(a) Time left until outcome: The last update was on June 26, 2025. So from now to that date is about 18 days.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, meaning smartphones will continue existing as they do now unless changed significantly.

(c) No outcome scenario: I need to think of a situation where the answer would be "No."

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Conditions that lead to AR glasses replacing smartphones by 2030.

I'm not entirely sure about all these parts, but let's go through them one by one.

(a) The time left until the outcome is known. If it's June 26, 2025, and I'm looking at this date from today, there are about 18 days left. That’s a short period for any significant change to occur.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, meaning smartphones will stick around as they do until perhaps by 2030 or beyond. This is the assumption that current tech and market dynamics won't change much in the next few years.

(c) No outcome scenario: I need to think of a way where AR glasses wouldn’t replace smartphones by 2030. Possible scenarios could include:

1. Changes in consumer preferences towards AR over time.
2. Tech companies like Meta and others shifting focus away from AR devices.
3. Major shifts in market adoption that reduce the demand for AR technologies.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: Conditions where AR glasses are expected to replace smartphones by 2030. This could involve:

1. Rapid development of AR technologies.
2. Significant adoption of virtual experiences through the metaverse.
3. Advances in AI enabling better integration of immersive elements into real-world interactions without traditional smartphone needs.

Considering all these factors, it seems likely that smartphones will continue to be prominent unless there are major shifts. However, predicting a 100% probability is difficult because other factors like market competition and individual preferences can affect the outcome.

Based on my understanding, I think the status quo (smartphones persisting) is the most probable scenario, with a high but not certain probability around 80%. The no outcome scenario seems unlikely unless there are significant external factors pushing the answer towards "No."

**Probability: 80%**

The status quo is likely, meaning smartphones will continue to be the primary platform until possibly by 2030 or beyond.

**Probability: 80%**

Smartphones will continue to dominate as the primary platform for virtual experiences until possibly by 2030 or beyond.
