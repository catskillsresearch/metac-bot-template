Alright, so I need to figure out if China's yuan would likely stay dominant before 2030. Let me break this down step by step. First, I should understand what each forecast mentioned. They give different reasons for the outcome, like why the dollar might dominate or not.

The user provided some key points from forecasts, including the share of the yuan and others in global payments from 2023 to 2025. The yuan's share went up by about 4% each year, while others' shares increased more rapidly. This suggests that the yuan isn't leading all the way to a No outcome.

Now, considering expert forecasts, they give extra weight to the status quo because changes are slow and gradual. That means if something happens, it might not change everything at once but probably happen over time. So, even if there's some shift, it's less likely to be sudden and significant compared to what could happen quickly.

Looking at the factors: geopolitical tensions can affect currencies, economic uncertainties, trade policiesâ€”things that are handled over time rather than in a flash. Markets and governments adjust mechanisms to manage currencies smoothly without forcing big changes overnight.

So, thinking about this, I'd lean towards a No outcome if something like a major shift occurs, but since it's gradual and not sudden, the status quo is more likely. Therefore, the probability of No outcome would be higher, perhaps around 85%.

But maybe there are exceptions or specific scenarios where significant changes could occur, making the Yes outcome possible. However, overall, I think the status quo remains favored because of the gradual nature of these changes.

Probability: 90%

The final answer is that China's yuan is likely to remain dominant before 2030 due to gradual changes and lack of sudden shifts.

The probability that China's yuan will remain dominant in global foreign exchange payments before 2030 is estimated at **85%**, considering the gradual nature of changes and existing mechanisms preventing sudden shifts.
