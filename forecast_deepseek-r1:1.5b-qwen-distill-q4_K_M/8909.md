Okay, I need to figure out the possible outcomes for this scenario. The user provided a lot of data and detailed scenarios, including various expert opinions and percentage changes. They want each part (a) through (e) formatted similarly with specific percentages and dollar amounts.

First, looking at part (a): The time left until the outcome is known. Since nothing has changed from today's situation and we're talking about a few months ahead, I think it makes sense to say around 10: 50%.

For part (b), expecting no change would likely mean the same result as today, so maybe 10: 65-70%.

Part (c): If the current trend continues, with previous trends showing a steady increase each month, by August, which is two months later, it might double that trend to around 80%.

For part (d), considering recent data and expert opinions, they're more confident now, so I'll go with 70%.

Part (e): An unexpected low outcome could reduce the expected value significantly. Maybe around 10% reduction.

Finally, part (f): An unexpected high outcome would drive up the market much higher. Perhaps 45% increase.

Now, putting all these together in a clear and concise format:
