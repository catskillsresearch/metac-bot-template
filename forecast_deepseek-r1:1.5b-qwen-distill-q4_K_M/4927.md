Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a series of questions about different scenarios and outcomes related to space exploration and investment trends. They set up a framework with different parts (a) through (g), each asking for an outcome based on various factors like time left until knowing something, expert predictions, etc.

First, I need to understand what "True" refers to. It seems like it's the highest expected value or figure they have in mind. Looking at their last message, where satellites ETFs are projected worth $1.8 trillion by 2035, this might be their "True" value for that context.

Assuming "True" is $1.8 trillion, each part can be filled out based on various forecasts and historical data:

(a) Time left until known about True: Let's say it was predicted to become more accurate in four years.
(b) Expert predictions vs. No change scenario:
   - 2035: Expressed as "None of the following" or an unspecified figure.
   - 2040: $1.8 trillion
   - 2045: $2.3 trillion
   - 2050: $2.7 trillion
(c) Trend continues:
   - 2040: $1.8 trillion
   - 2045: $2.3 trillion
(d) Expert expectations:
   - 2040: $1.5 trillion
   - 2045: $2.0 trillion
(e) Market trends:
   - 2040: $3.0 trillion
   - 2045: $7.2 trillion
(f) Unexpected scenarios (higher than True):
   - 2040: $10.5 trillion
   - 2045: $30.0 trillion
(g) Unexpected lower outcomes:
   - 2040: $0.3 trillion
   - 2045: $0.7 trillion

However, without specific guidance from the user on what "True" should be, it's challenging to provide precise time estimates and percentages. The key is that each part will reflect historical trends and expert projections based on available data.
