Alright, let me try to figure out this probability question about Russia's GDP in 2025. So, we're given several forecasts from different experts and a rationale section from one of them. I need to combine these into a final consistent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual forecast.

First, all the forecasts mention a growth rate between 2-4% annually, up to 2035, with Russia's GDP expected to double by then. They also talk about sustainable growth rates and similar targets across different regions. That seems pretty consistent.

I think the key points are:
1. The growth rates are expected to be consistent.
2. Russia is expected to grow steadily, not too fast.
3. The economy isn't likely to collapse or have sudden changes due to external factors unless there's a major shift in policies or technology.

Looking at the user's final rationale, they mention that there are several consistent projections across different regions and that growth rates are expected to be sustainable. They also note that all forecasts align on consistent growth trends, which adds to the confidence.

I should consider any exceptions. For example, if one forecast says a faster rate is possible due to certain policies or events, but others warn against it, how do I handle that? I guess since all experts agree on the trend, the overall outcome is more likely to be consistent with those projections.

Also, considering historical data and structural factors like education and infrastructure, which are key for economic growth. If these areas haven't changed much recently, it supports stable growth rates.

I think the probability leans towards a Yes because all the expert forecasts support consistent growth without major changes, aligning with Russia's current momentum.

Probability: 90-95%

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: [No information provided].

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: A Yes outcome with a probability of 90%.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: If Russia faces significant economic disruptions, such as prolonged political tensions or external shocks, leading to slower growth and a drop in the exchange rate.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: With steady economic growth and potential policy reforms, Russia is projected to achieve a 6% GDP growth rate, with stable exchange rates if trade policies are maintained.

### Probability: 95%
