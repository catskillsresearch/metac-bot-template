To determine the probability of each outcome, we analyze the given information and assess potential factors influencing champion stock performance.

(a) Time left until no outcome: Unknown - More information is needed to calculate this.
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed: If all companies are from different sectors with varying fundamentals but strong growth potential, it's possible that these collectively form champions. However, sector-specific volatility may hinder their ability to meet champion standards.
(c) No outcome scenario: If external factors like sector-specific challenges or market volatility disrupt performance, no champions could emerge. This is a plausible outcome based on current conditions and industry diversity.

Probability: 92-100%

Source:
Given the broad industry coverage and varied fundamentals, it's reasonable to estimate a high probability that these companies can collectively form champions due to sector diversity and potential external factors not detailed in the scenario.

(b) Probability:

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: 
If all companies are from different sectors with varying fundamentals but strong growth potential over three years, there's potential for them to collectively form champion stocks. This is plausible given current market conditions and industry dynamics, leading to a high probability of this outcome.

Probability:

Status quo outcome: 92-100%

Source:
Considering the broad industry coverage and varied fundamentals, it's reasonable to estimate a high probability that these companies can collectively form champions due to sector diversity and external factors not detailed in the scenario.

### Probability: 85%
