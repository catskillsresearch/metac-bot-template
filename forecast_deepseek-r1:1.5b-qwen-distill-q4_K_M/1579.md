Alright, let me break this down. The user has provided a history with detailed information about China's economic future, including GDP projections, energy sectors, trade tensions, and domestic factors. They've also asked how to assess the probability of China's GDP surpassing the US by 2050.

First, I need to determine how much time is left until the answer is provided. The user mentioned June 26, 2025, which would be 3 days from that date. 

Next, I should identify the status quo outcome if nothing changed. Looking at my initial response, it was at around 2024, so today is one year later, making it time to update that.

For scenarios (c) and (d), I need to create hypothetical situations leading to a No or Yes outcome regarding China's GDP growth by 2030.

A No outcome scenario could involve continued economic instability due to external factors or internal challenges like military spending. A Yes outcome would imply improved policies, domestic support, or significant investments in clean energy sectors that lead to higher GDP contributions than the status quo.

Considering the information provided, I should present a balanced view with some probability leaning towards improvement but recognizing potential room for growth despite potential challenges.

(a) Time remaining until the outcome: **3 days** (June 27, 2025).  
(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:  
Probability was **46%**.  

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:  
A scenario where China's GDP growth remains unchanged despite efforts from the government and international organizations due to external factors like military spending or internal challenges such as hyperinflation or supply chain oversupply, leading to long-term imbalance.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:  
A scenario where China's GDP grows significantly by 2030 due to improved policies, domestic support, or significant investments in clean energy sectors like solar and wind power, which could contribute more than the US' GDP by 2049.

### Probability: 70%
