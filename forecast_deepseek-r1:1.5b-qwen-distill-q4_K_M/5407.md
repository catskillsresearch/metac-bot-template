Probability: 85%

(a) Time left until the outcome would be estimated if there were expected timelines for key events. If these developments are expected to occur quickly, the time remaining is short.

(b) Status quo (assuming nothing changes): This would represent the assumption that the current state remains unchanged despite rapid development.

(c) No outcome: A scenario where unexpected challenges or faster changes occur first, leading to early disruption of Starlink's operations and Tesla's leadership.

(d) Yes outcome: This would occur if significant changes disrupt current trends, such as Starlink going private in response to Tesla's leadership shifts, thereby affecting both the company and the telecommunications market.

### Probability: 90%
