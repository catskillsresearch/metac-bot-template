Alright, so let me try to figure out the probability of each part. 

First, (a) says the time left until the outcome is known, but I don't know what that refers to since it's vague. Maybe it's about something else unrelated.

Then, (b) is the status quo where nothing changes. Since forecasters put extra weight on that, I'll go with 100%.

(c) A scenario resulting in no change would be if things change but not in line with what people expect. So, maybe an economic downturn affecting investments. That should result in a "No" outcome.

(d) A yes outcome could be if major industry shifts happen despite some staying the same, like a merger that changes sectors without companies jumping into new ones.

So overall:

(a) Not sure about probability for time left.

(b) 100%

(c) No outcome, maybe an economic downturn.

(d) Yes outcome, industry shifts.
