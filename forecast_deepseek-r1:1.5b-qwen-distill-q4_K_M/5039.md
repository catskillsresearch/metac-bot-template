# Europe's Future

Europe is at the brink of significant changes in 2030, driven by ongoing conflicts, economic issues, and internal tensions. Experts warn that NATO and the EU may face a collapse due to de-Usah-centric policies and a lack of resilience. However, there are also potential signs of recovery with increased defense spending and European efforts to address its challenges.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Status quo Outcome:** If Europe continues to function as is, it could see some hope for recovery despite the current issues.
2. **No Outcome Scenario:** 
   - **U.S. Tariffs Leaves Europe Unstable:** A complete departure through tariffs and economic measures could lead to a decline in energy dependence.
   - **Energy Competition from North to South:** This could disrupt Europe's ability to recover.
3. **Yes Outcome Scenario:** Strategies like increased defense spending, improved EU-ECB relations, and resilience show Europe's capacity for some recovery.

### Final Probability Rationale:
The 2030 scenario offers some hope for recovery but isn't guaranteed. However, significant shifts could lead to a Yes outcome with potential for European stability. The future is uncertain, with each scenario presenting its own set of risks and opportunities.

### Probability: 75%
