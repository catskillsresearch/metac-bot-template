### Forecast for Workforce Hours in Germany (EWG) by 2030:

(a) **Time left until known outcome**:  
Currently, no data is available on workforce trends yet. This might be within the next 6 months as changes are emerging rapidly.

(b) **Status quo (nothing changed)**:  
The average weekly working hours in Germany are currently set at 34.3 hours. If nothing changes, this remains our current standard.

(c) **Trend continued**:  
Assuming the historical trend continues, workforce hours will increase over time. This might take around 10 years by 2030 to reach a productivity goal.

(d) **Expert expectations**:  
Experts and market data suggest that workforce hours will adjust based on industry needs. They might average between 36-37 hours per week.

(e) **Unexpected low outcome scenario**:  
An unexpected drop in working hours could occur during economic downturns, leading to lower workforce participation.

(f) **Unexpected high outcome scenario**:  
A significant increase in workforce hours could result from unforeseen events like a pandemic causing displacement and increased reliance on specialized labor.
