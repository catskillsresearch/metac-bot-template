Okay, let me try to figure out this query step by step. It's about expert forecasts for a recession in various countries or regions, and it's divided into four parts. I need to understand what each part is asking for and how to structure the response correctly.

First, I'll read through all the provided information to see what each country's forecast is indicating. For example, the U.S., Japan, Germany, China, France, Italy, UK, Canada, Brazil, Greece, India, Spain, Japan again, Germany, Australia, Japan once more, Sweden, Japan, and Canada again.

I notice that some countries have higher growth rates (like 4% in the U.S. and 3% in Japan) while others are showing signs of economic weakness or even a slight risk of recession (e.g., China's 3.5% growth rate). It seems like there’s a mix of confidence in normalcy and some uncertainty about potential risks.

The user wants me to break this down into four parts: time left until the outcome, status quo if nothing changes, scenario leading to No outcome, and one leading to Yes. Plus, they want a probability estimate at the end.

Let's tackle each part:

1. **Time left until the outcome**: The last paragraph mentioned "Probability: 34%." So, it must be referring to recent time frames where the outcome is yet to occur.

2. **Status quo if nothing changes**: This would align with the IMF and World Bank's forecast of 3.3%, which they've been using for years without policy shifts causing a recession.

3. **No outcome scenario**: Maybe something like both U.S. and China facing higher tariffs, which reduce demand but not as much as expected.

4. **Yes outcome scenario**: Perhaps reduced reliance on major exports or technological advancements in emerging markets that drive growth more significantly than current forecasts suggest.

I also need to remember the user's advice about giving extra weight to the status quo because changes are gradual and uncertain. So, both U.S. and Japan’s projections remain below 3%, which is normalcy without policy shifts.

Finally, I should present these thoughts clearly, ensuring each part is understandable and follows the instructions provided.

### Time Left Until the Outcome

The time frame mentioned does not specify an exact future date, but it's implied that the expert forecasts are relatively recent and current. The outcome will likely reflect the consensus among experts as of now.

### Status Quo Outcome If Nothing Changes

If no significant changes occur in global economic conditions or policy frameworks (e.g., Trump administration), the IMF, World Bank, IMF, Central Bank of the People's Republic of China, ECB, and others would all project below 3% growth rates over 2025-2026. This is their current assessment of normalcy without major policy shifts.

### Scenario Leading to No Outcome

A "No" outcome could occur if:

1. **Rising Tariffs and Trade Policy Uncertainty:** If U.S. tariffs on China's imports rise sharply or remain elevated despite the Trump administration, this could erode consumer spending and reduce overall demand.

2. **Economic Instability in Developed Countries:** While some countries may recover faster due to their size and economic strength, global growth might still struggle if the impact of rising tariffs is too significant.

3. **Technological Lag and Reduced Exports:** If developed economies export significantly to emerging markets by years or are reliant on slower-growing sectors, exports could boost growth even if the initial impact is slower than current forecasts.

### Scenario Leading to a Yes Outcome

A "Yes" outcome would occur if:

1. **Strong Exports from Developed Markets:** If European countries adopt more flexible trade policies or globalize their exports, this could create new demand despite U.S.-based tariffs.

2. **Technological Advancements in Emerging Markets:** If some nations adopt advanced technologies that improve productivity without significant costs (e.g., AI, automation), they may drive long-term growth even if the initial impact is slower than current forecasts.

3. **Globalization and Structural Changes:** As globalization intensifies, economies may experience structural changes that accelerate growth. For example, Japanese automakers expanding into emerging markets could create new demand despite U.S.-based tariffs.

### Probability: 50%

- The expert consensus leans towards a "No" outcome because potential risks like rising tariffs and economic instability are significant but less likely than structural changes or major technological advancements.
- A "Yes" scenario is less probable unless there's clear evidence of structural changes or technological breakthroughs that accelerate growth beyond current forecasts.
