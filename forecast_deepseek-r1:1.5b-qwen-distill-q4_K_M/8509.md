Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this question about Meta AI reaching 1 billion monthly users. The user provided several sources showing Meta AI surpassing that target, which suggests it's already in the status quo. But the question is about scenarios leading to a No or Yes outcome if nothing changes.

(a) How many days until Meta AI surpasses 1 billion? Since Meta AI was mentioned across multiple sources and reached above 1 billion in several places, I'm not sure of the exact time left for that. It might be in April or May 2025.

(b) Status quo outcome: If nothing changes, Meta AI will continue its current growth rate in progress. It's expected to surpass 1 billion as planned.

(c) No outcome scenario: Perhaps a major competitor emerges within a year, blocking growth and preventing Meta from reaching 1 billion.

(d) Yes outcome scenario: New features or improvements could boost user count beyond 1 billion, making it exceed the target.

So, summarizing:

(a) The exact time left is unknown.
(b) Status quo holds as Meta AI continues to surpass 1 billion.
(c) If external factors block growth, no outcome occurs.
(d) New features can lead to exceeding 1 billion.

Final Answer:
(a) Time left until Meta AI surpasses 1 billion: Not sure.  
(b) Current status quo: Meta AI continues to reach beyond 1 billion as planned.  
(c) No outcome scenario: External factors prevent growth within a year.  
(d) Yes outcome scenario: New features improve user count beyond 1 billion.

This helps understand the expected outcomes based on current trends and forecasts.
