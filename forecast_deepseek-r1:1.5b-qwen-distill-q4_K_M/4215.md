Alright, I need to figure out how to approach this forecast question about India's GDP for 2025 based on the given data and trends. Let me break it down step by step.

First, looking at (a), it says the time left until the outcome is known is two quarters from now. So, if I'm forecasting for a date in 2025, that's when the final update will be necessary.

Next, (b) refers to the status quo outcome if nothing changes. The data indicates an expected growth rate of 6.5% annually for FY25, which aligns with previous trends and consensus estimates.

For part (c), if the current trend continues at a 6.5% annual growth rate as projected, that would mean applying that rate over the next decade to project future GDP growth.

Part (d) is about expert expectations. They mentioned a long-term perspective with potential shifts due to AGI, which could influence these projections.

Part (e) describes an unexpected scenario where global growth prospects are uncertain. If GDPPHD in Q2 is only 5%, that would be a low outcome. This might lower the expected GDP figures if the trend continues.

Finally, part (f) talks about an unexpected high outcome: if GDPPHD in Q3 is 7.5% and there's further global growth slowing, that could increase the expected GDP growth, leading to higher figures.

Now, I need to present each percentage with its corresponding value as per their status quo and trends, making sure to list them from 10th percentile up to the highest outcome mentioned.
