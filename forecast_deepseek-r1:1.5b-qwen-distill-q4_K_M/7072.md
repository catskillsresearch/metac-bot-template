Alright, let's tackle this scenario step by step. We're looking at the upcoming European Women's Championship match between England and Belgium. The details provided suggest that England is in a strong position at the top of their group, with Belgium likely not performing well. 

First, I need to determine what factors could lead to an English victory. Since England is already top of their women's tournament, they have a competitive edge. They are unlikely to be eliminated unless the match heavily favors them, which seems improbable given their strong form.

Next, considering external factors like pandemics or political issues might play a role in changing the outcome, but these are less likely than team performance and standings.

Therefore, while there's a slight chance of an English victory due to the slowly changing world, the more significant factors are team performance.
