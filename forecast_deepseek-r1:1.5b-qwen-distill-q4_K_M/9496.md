Alright, let me break down how I arrived at that answer. First, I need to understand what each question is asking and then use the provided data to calculate the respective percentiles. 

For part (a), since we're talking about the time left until the outcome known by June 2025, there's no remaining time yet, so it's 0%. 

Part (b) simply states "nothing changed," meaning all current trends and percentages remain as they are up to June 26th, 2025.

For parts (c) through (f), which involve trends beyond the initial data provided, I need to extrapolate based on current trends. By June 26, 2025, wind and solar installations have grown significantly, especially as expected by experts who set wide confidence intervals for their forecasts.

Each percentile reflects how far along each metric has gotten by June 26th, considering the growth in wind and solar power.
