Okay, I'm trying to figure out how much time is left until the outcome is known. Let me see... The information given mentions that all data will be known by June 2026, so from June 2025 to June 2026 is just one month. So, (a) should be **1 month**.

Next, if nothing changes, what's the current GDP? From CEPLA, Peru's GDP in 2023 was $267.6 billion. If thereâ€™s no growth or changes, it remains at that figure. So, (b) is **$267.6 billion**.

If the trend continued, projecting future growth based on historical rate: From 2000 to 2023, that's 23 years with an annual increase of approximately 5%. Using compound interest formula: 

\[ \text{Future GDP} = \text{Current GDP} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Years}} \]

\[ \text{Future GDP} = \$267.6 billion \times (1 + 0.05)^{23} \approx \$2509 billion \]

So, (c) is **\$2509 billion**.

Experts and markets predict a 5% annual growth rate for Peru. This standard assumption models future trends, so the expected GDP remains at $267.6 billion. Thus, (d) is **$267.6 billion**.

An unexpected scenario could lead to unexpected outcomes: If economic recessions or crises in key sectors slow growth, resulting in lower GDP to $2084 billion. And an unexpected high scenario with technological breakthroughs leading to faster growth could reach $3009 billion by 2048. So, (e) is **$2084 billion** and (f) is **$3009 billion**.

Here are the final answers:

(a) **1 month**

(b) **\$267.6 billion**

(c) **\$2509 billion**

(d) **\$267.6 billion**

(e) **$2084 billion**

(f) **\$3009 billion**
