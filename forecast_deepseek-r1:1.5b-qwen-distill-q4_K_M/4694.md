Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the GDP of India by 2047 based on the information provided in each article. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at article (a), it mentions that we don't know when a specific forecast or study will conclude because the "time left until the outcome is known." Maybe I should note that as an unknown time frame for this part.

Then there's article (b), which states that if nothing changes, India's GDP by 2047 is projected to be $23–$35 trillion. So that seems like a baseline scenario where all other factors remain constant. I can represent this range in the answer as $29 billion since it's likely the median of that range.

Next, article (c) talks about if the current trend continues, India's GDP by 2047 would be $31 billion. This is interesting because it suggests a continuation of trends after what was previously projected. I can note this as part of the overall growth.

Moving on to article (d), which mentions that experts and markets expect India's GDP by 2047 to be between $28–$32 trillion. This gives me another specific range to work with.

Then, in article (e), there's an unexpected scenario where the economy could dip, leading to a low outcome of $19 billion. This is important because it introduces some unpredictability into the forecast.

Finally, article (f) discusses another unexpected high scenario where major changes in global trade patterns might result in India's GDP reaching $54.6 trillion. This highlights potential extremes in the GDP growth.

Now, to organize these findings into a structured answer with percentiles and values as specified:

10: $19 billion
20: 28–32 trillion
40: 31 billion
60: 29–34.5 trillion
80: 35 billion
90: $54.6 trillion

I think this approach makes sense because it captures both the specific trends and the potential unpredictability of these GDP forecasts.
