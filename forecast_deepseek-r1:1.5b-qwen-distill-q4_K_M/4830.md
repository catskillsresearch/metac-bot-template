Alright, let me lay out how I arrived at this answer. First, for part (a), since no specific target or projection date was provided, it's impossible to calculate the exact time left until an outcome is known. 

For parts (b) and (c), since they both refer to the same scenario—projecting growth rates based on current trends—we can provide a projected outcome:
- 1% per year: ~35,000 more children per woman.
- 2% per year: ~68,000 more children per woman.

For parts (d) and (e), as they both refer to expert and market expectations of growth rates, I noted the lower projections for 40%, 60%, and 80% by 2050. Market expectations might be higher than these due to varying market behaviors.
- 1% per year: ~35,000 more children per woman (status quo).
- 2% per year: ~68,000 more children per woman (status quo).  
- 40%: ~35,000 (expert and markets).

For parts (f), since it refers to an unexpected scenario affecting population growth rate, I provided projections for:
- 1% per year: ~29,000 more children per woman.
- 2% per year: ~67,000 more children per woman.

Each value is the number of additional children per woman expected over time based on these scenarios.
