Okay, so I need to figure out how much money to invest in a savings account. Let me break this down step by step based on what I understand from today's discussion.

First, if nothing changes, Bitcoin might keep its status quo. That means it could be stable or even gain more market share because of its innovative tech and potential acceptance across regions.

If there are significant price drops despite rising volumes due to technical issues, regulatory changes, or geopolitical events, the community might decide not to invest heavily. This could lead to Bitcoin's market share being fragmented or declining.

On the other hand, if Bitcoin gains traction from increasing demand, government initiatives, or technological advancements (like adoption by banks and traditional systems), it could become a major player in the market. Investors who value its potential growth would be more likely to invest.

So, considering all these scenarios, I think there's a decent chance Bitcoin might see some growth, but it's also important to stay cautious due to its rapid evolution in the crypto space.

To determine how much money to invest in a savings account, consider these factors:

1. **Market Trends:** If the market is trending upwards or if there are significant price drops despite rising volumes due to technical issues, you might decide not to invest.

2. **Status quo:** Bitcoin's status quo as stable or gaining momentum suggests it could be a safe bet for some investors.

3. **Growth Potential:** If Bitcoin gains traction from increasing demand or technological advancements, its growth potential increases, appealing to those valuing security and innovation.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 50% Yes, 50% No  

Investing in Bitcoin might depend on whether market trends align with your risk tolerance and how much you're willing to lose.

### Probability: 60%
