Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond based on the information provided.

(a) Time left until the outcome is known: **June 26, 2025**. So today (June 26) is the final day of data collection.

(b) The status quo if nothing changes: This would be a normal market performance with no significant shifts in expectations or events affecting investor sentiment.

(c) A scenario leading to a "No" outcome: Perhaps a major event like a severe economic downturn could cause investors to sell assets and hold underperforming ones, which might slow growth despite positive earnings.

(d) A scenario resulting in a "Yes" outcome: If the market starts to grow again due to better-than-expected earnings or favorable trends, it could signal a bubble is imminent.

I'll summarize my understanding of each part clearly and concisely.

(a) The time left until the outcome is known: **June 26, 2025**. This means we have all the necessary data up to today.

(b) The status quo if nothing changes: A normal market performance with no significant shifts in expectations or events affecting investor sentiment.

(c) A scenario leading to a "No" outcome: A sudden economic downturn could cause investors to sell assets, slowing growth even as earnings increase.

(d) A scenario resulting in a "Yes" outcome: If the market starts to grow again due to better-than-expected earnings, it might signal a bubble is about to burst.

### Probability: 75%
