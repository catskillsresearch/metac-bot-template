Okay, so I'm trying to understand how Tesla's stock might perform in the future. Let me start by looking at what information I have about Tesla's market cap and its performance over time.

First, Tesla's current market cap is around $345 billion as of June 26th, 2025. They are priced per share at $302.80, which means their total equity is approximately $1 trillion. This figure includes both common stock and preferred stock.

Now, let me go through each forecast line to see how Tesla might fare:

(a) **Time left until outcome known**: Well, I don't have any specific information about when the current trend will continue, so this is unknown.
(b) **Status quo (nothing changes)**: If nothing changes, what would Tesla's price be? Based on their performance, it seems like Tesla continues to increase in value. So if nothing else happens, they might stay above $302 per share.

(c) **Trend continued**: If the current upward trend continues, what would Tesla's price be? To figure this out, I need to look at past trends. From June 13, 2022, to now, the stock has been steadily increasing. Let me check that growth rate. It went from $268 per share on March 30, 2022, to $302.80 on July 14, 2025. That's a 4.8% increase each year or around a 7.5% overall increase since June 2022. If the trend continues, Tesla might continue rising.

(d) **Experts' expectations**: Experts have set wide ranges for Tesla's price target. On June 26th, they lifted their price target to $326.50 from the previous week's high of $317.47. That means they expect Tesla to reach that level based on their analysis and projections.

(e) **Low outcome scenario**: If there were any significant economic issues or political instability, what could happen? Tesla is in a good position with recent success in Europe and other markets, so maybe it's less likely to drop significantly due to external factors. But without major changes, I'd expect Tesla to remain stable or rise slightly.

(f) **High outcome scenario**: If there were any major tech moves by competitors like NVIDIA or AMD, what could happen? If new tech makes Tesla new competitors, their growth might push Tesla's price up. However, given current trends and Tesla's position in the EV sector, this seems less likely unless something unexpected happens.

In summary:
- (a): Unknown
- (b): $302
- (c): ~$328
- (d): $326.50
- (e): Possible low outcome of -14%
- (f): Possible high outcome of $400

I think the best estimate is that Tesla's stock might be around $328 to $400, depending on how things go.

Here are the estimated values for Tesla's stock in different scenarios based on market expectations:

(a) **Percentile 10**: $302.00 (Status quo outcome)
(b) **Percentile 50**: $328.00
(c) **Percentile 70**: $346.00
(d) **Percentile 90**: $378.00

These estimates are based on historical performance and expert expectations, showing a range from stable at $302 to potential gains up to $400 if other factors significantly impact Tesla's growth.
