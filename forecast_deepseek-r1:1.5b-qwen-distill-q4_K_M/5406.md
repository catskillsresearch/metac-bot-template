Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of doubling global nuclear power capacity by 2050. Let's break this down step by step because it's a bit complex. 

First, there's this report from the GECF that says nuclear power will double from its current level to about 870 GW by 2050. That's significant and aligns with their growth projection. They mention increased investment in new reactors, which makes sense because more capacity means higher demand.

Now, I remember reading that the WNA has been pushing for this ambitious goal. They're not just backing it up but actively participating in it through various initiatives. Plus, they've made a statement about supporting this increase, which reinforces their commitment. Thatâ€™s a good sign for a Yes outcome.

On the other hand, I'm thinking about other factors that could impact this goal. Like, global energy policies might be tight or other countries might push back on investments if nuclear isn't an option. There could be supply chain issues as different regions are building up their gas reserves. Also, political tensions in some areas could affect how projects are accepted.

But I'm also considering the economic factors. With population growth and increasing energy demands, demand for natural gas will go up, which should support the expansion of nuclear power capacity. Companies that stick to their investments without distractions might overcome these challenges over time. International aid might come into play if one region is struggling with supply issues.

In summary, while there are some potential external factors that could influence the outcome, given the companies' active participation and the supportive policies from international bodies, it seems like a Yes outcome is likely by 2050. However, I should keep an eye on any recent statistics or studies to see how current efforts compare to what's needed. 

I think this gives me more confidence that the answer is indeed a Yes. But I'll have to double-check if there are any recent reports or data showing progress in the past and projected numbers for 2050. That could provide even more assurance.

**Final Answer:**

Probability: 90%
