Alright, I need to figure out how likely it is for today's forecast about extreme poverty in Nigeria and DRC to result in a "Yes" or "No." Let me start by understanding each part of the user's instructions. 

First, (a) says the time left until the outcome is known. But since the question hasn't been answered yet, maybe it expects placeholders.

Next, (b) is about status quo if nothing changes. That should be straightforwardâ€”the current state of affairs as of today, assuming no changes occur.

(c) Scenario leading to No outcome: A situation where extreme poverty remains despite efforts and reforms in place, possibly due to persistent social or environmental issues not being addressed.

(d) Scenario for Yes: Progress is made, especially with some help from other developing countries. They might invest more in infrastructure, education, and trade.

The user also mentioned that good forecasters weight status quo more because changes are gradual. So maybe the probability of each scenario is around 50%, but perhaps No is slightly favored due to persistent issues?

Finally, I should mention that both scenarios have their own probabilities based on current trends and data.

(a) **Time left until outcome**: The question doesn't specify what the "outcome" will be.  

(b) **Status quo if nothing changes**:  
**Current Status quo (2025-06-26)**:  
- 622 million people will still live in extreme poverty by 2030.  
- Hinder by roughly the same number.  
- Moderate to severe food insecurity affecting about 733 million people.  
- A fifth of children under five have growth retardation due to lack of access to electricity.

(c) **Scenario leading to No outcome**:  
A scenario where extreme poverty persists despite efforts and reforms in place, possibly due to persistent social or environmental issues not being addressed.

(d) **Scenario leading to Yes outcome**:  
A scenario where progress is made, particularly with some help from other developing countries, addressing social and economic challenges effectively.

This response assumes the status quo remains unchanged as of June 26, 2025.
