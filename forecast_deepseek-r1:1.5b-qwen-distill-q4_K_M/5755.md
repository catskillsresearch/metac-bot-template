Okay, so I'm trying to understand this question about China's economy in June 2025. The user provided a lot of information and wants specific outcomes based on different scenarios. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question asks for the GDP growth ratio for China until June 26, 2025. They mentioned status quo as not changing from June 26, 2024, so I'll use that as the baseline.

The current trend is continuing to grow, which means the economy should pick up pace without any major disruptions. So, the growth shouldn't be too low or too high compared to past periods.

For unexpected scenarios:
- A low outcome could mean unexpected things like a sudden decline in clean energy adoption due to geopolitical reasons.
- A high outcome might involve unexpected technological breakthroughs that boost investments more than expected.

I think it's important to consider factors like new industries emerging or changes in labor markets that could affect growth. Also, unexpected events beyond current trends, like political changes or economic shifts, can impact the economy differently.

Overall, I need to make sure the percentages are realistic and reflect any known data around that time.
