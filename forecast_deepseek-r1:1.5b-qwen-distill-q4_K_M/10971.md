Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to this query about cryptocurrency forecasts. The user provided several data points and market research insights, so first, I should parse all the details carefully.

They've given me three sets of forecast information:

1. CoinMarketCap's data on Bitcoin's price and volume trends.
2. Market researcher insights on different scenarios like trend continuation, expert expectations, unexpected scenarios, etc.

My task is to break down each part into specific predictions based on these data points.

Let me go through each section one by one.

---

### Part (a): Time left until the outcome is known
The user asks for the time remaining before a known outcome occurs. Looking at the provided data, there are no actual future dates beyond 2025-06-26. So it's currently unknown when the outcome will be determined.

**Answer:** The time left until the outcome is known is 0 days.

---

### Part (b): Status quo outcome if nothing changes
This refers to what happens if there are no changes in the market conditions, such as prices staying flat or remaining unchanged. From the provided data, Bitcoin has a slight decline in price and market cap, but not everything remains the same yet.

**Answer:** The status quo outcome is that Bitcoin price remains at $97,973.34 with some minor declines in market cap.

---

### Part (c): Trend continuation
This asks what will happen if the current trend continues. The user expects a slow and steady increase in Bitcoin's price and volume. However, factors like regulatory changes or technological advancements could shift this trajectory.

**Answer:** Bitcoin is expected to continue rising steadily with a 1% annual increase over the next three years.

---

### Part (d): Experts' expectations
This refers to experts' predictions about Bitcoin's growth rate. They predict cautious growth of 3% per year, reflecting potential inflationary pressures and market uncertainty.

**Answer:** Experts predict a steady 3% annual growth rate for Bitcoin price in the short term.

---

### Part (e): Unexpected scenario leading to low outcome
An unexpected scenario could involve Bitcoin losing value due to market volatility or increased regulatory scrutiny. This leads to a lower price compared to current trends.

**Answer:** A brief scenario where Bitcoin loses value may result in a low price, though not drastic.

---

### Part (f): Unexpected scenario leading to high outcome
A more extreme scenario could involve significant inflationary pressures or investor pessimism that boosts Bitcoin's price beyond expected levels.

**Answer:** An unexpected scenario might push Bitcoin's price much higher due to inflationary concerns.

For each scenario, I'll provide the respective percentage and dollar amount:

| Percentage | Value in Billion $ |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 10            | 859.2             |
| 20            | 874              |
| 40            | 939              |
| 60            | 968              |
| 80            | 979              |
