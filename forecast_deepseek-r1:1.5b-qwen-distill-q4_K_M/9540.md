Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of Peloton Interactive's (PTON) stock going up by June 2025 based on the given information. Each forecast has different data points about their performance, market trends, and competitive landscape. I need to combine these pieces into a coherent rationale that incorporates the best of each individual rationale.

First, let's look at the market size and growth projections. The global leisure travel market is growing at around 18.3% annually from 2024 to 2033, reaching $6.2 trillion by 2033. Peloton Interactive has a strong presence in connected fitness services, particularly among self-contained strength training exercises. They also have multiple segments like weight loss, yoga & meditation, and HIIT & strength training subscriptions.

Next, the growth of online fitness app market is projected to be around 14-16% from 2024 to 2032, with North America leading at 37%, LATAM, and West Europe at 18%. This suggests a significant expansion in customer base. However, Peloton might face competition from major companies like MyFitnessPal or others entering the same space.

The market research indicates that they analyze key manufacturers, segments, market share, and competition. They also focus on developing software solutions for fitness tools to diversify revenue streams. This smart approach could attract new users and diversify income.

Finally, Peloton Interactive is expected to achieve core profits of $300M to $350M in 2025, including cost cuts. Their CEO plans are promising but they're worried about reaching sustained growth. The shift from hardware to software models might offer room for future expansion and diversification.

Considering all these factors, Peloton's focus on subscriptions, expanding into software solutions, and their competitive presence suggest a favorable outlook for their stock. However, without more information about upcoming competition or technological advancements that could impact their strategies, it's hard to be certain. Based on the best of each forecast, I lean towards a "Yes" outcome.

Probability: 95%

### Probability: 75%
