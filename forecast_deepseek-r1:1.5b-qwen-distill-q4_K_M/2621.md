Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this question about economic growth in the US by 2047 based on the provided information. Let me break down each part and see what it means for the overall outcome.

First, there's a CBO report from March 27, 2025, which says that US economic growth will slow down over the next 30 years due to weak population gains and increased government spending. The CBO also warns that without immigration, the U.S. population will start shrinking in 2033. This seems concerning because if more people are moving abroad instead of domestically, it could affect both domestic and international economies.

Next, there's an IMF report from March 27, 2025, which mentions India's growth rate is projected at 6.5% for 2024-25 and 2025-26, lower than previous years due to declining manufacturing, mining, and construction sectors. The IMF recommends structural reforms, human capital enhancement, greater women participation in labor force, and more employment opportunities.

Then, there's a World Bank report from March 27, 2025, which suggests that India needs to grow by an average of 7.8% over the next 22 years to achieve high income status by 2047. It also mentions increased investment from 33.5% of GDP in 2025 to 40% (real terms) by 2035, higher labor participation from 56.4% to above 65%, and faster overall productivity growth.

The CBO's forecast also states that the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach 156% in 2055, which is lower than previous projections but not better than even some advanced economies like Japan or Germany.

Now, putting this all together:

- **Potential for Slower Growth**: The US and India are already experiencing signs of slowing economic growth. The CBO's report highlights the challenges due to population decline and government spending, while the IMF and World Bank provide additional context about India's sectoral issues.
  
- **No Outcome Scenario**: This could happen if all agencies report a decline in growth without any immediate changes being made. However, given the time frame of 30 years, significant changes are expected over this period.

- **Status quo Outcome**: If no major changes occur, the U.S. and India would continue their current trends, aligning with existing forecasts and policy frameworks.

- **Yes Outcome Scenario**: This could result if there's a rapid shift in growth rates or structural reforms occur quickly to support advanced economies. For example, technological advancements or new investment policies that accelerate growth.

### Rationale:
Good forecasters tend to prioritize the status quo outcome because it is generally more stable and predictable over time. They assume that slow changes are easier to anticipate compared to rapidly shifting scenarios. This focus on current trends makes the status quo outcomes particularly reliable for predictions in the long run.

**Probability: 85-90%**

Based on these scenarios, I'm going to provide a probability estimate of **85-90%** that the status quo outcome will prevail by 2047. This reflects the stable trends seen in both the US and India, with existing policies aligning with the current forecasts.

### Final Answer:

The time left until the outcome is known: **120 days** from June 26, 2025.  
The status quo outcome if nothing changed: No changes would occur as expected.  
A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Global events such as political tensions or natural disasters could impact the economy but are not expected to cause major shifts over the next 120 days.  
A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Significant changes, such as technological advancements or policy reforms, could accelerate growth and support advanced economies by 2047.  

### Rationale:
Good forecasters weight the status quo outcome more heavily because it is generally considered more stable and predictable over time. They assume that slow changes are easier to anticipate compared to rapidly shifting scenarios.

**Probability: 85-90%**

The probability estimate of **85-90%** indicates a moderate focus on the status quo outcome, reflecting the expected stability in current trends for both the US and India.

### Probability: 80%
