Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of Turkey changing its inflation strategy by 2025. The user has provided several sources with different perspectives, but they're all focused on inflation expectations and policies. Let me break this down step by step.

First, looking at the expert opinions section, they mention that market participants' surveys showed improved inflation expectations over two years, dropping from 2024 to 2025, which reached 27.1%. This suggests that people are expecting lower costs in the near future, which could indicate that central banks can tighten their policies. The target remains below 40%, so maybe they can adjust rates based on this data.

However, there's also a point about market participants' surveys being less reliable this year compared to previous years due to economic uncertainty. This could cause misinterpretation of current expectations, leading some economists to think that the actual situation is more volatile than anticipated. If people overestimate their ability to handle rising costs, they might have a lower target, which could complicate things.

On the flip side, some market participants may not see an improvement in expectations due to uncertainty and economic changes, leading them to believe that inflation hasn't cooled down as much as it should. This could result in central banks needing to increase rates more aggressively or slow down growth further than planned.

Considering all these factors, I think the economy is experiencing a slowdown in demand while supply chains face challenges like high prices due to inflation. This combination might mean that central banks can either maintain or tighten their monetary policies depending on how expectations and economic conditions react. However, given the uncertainty and survey data showing lower expectation improvements over two years, it's possible that the economy could stabilize at 43% in 2026 with no changes.

I'm also considering the role of inflationary pressure. If the economy starts to cool off with lower market participants' surveys, central banks can adjust their policies to match the new data. But if there's still uncertainty and expectations don't improve as much, it might lead to higher costs in the short term, prompting tightening rates more aggressively.

In summary, without changes, I think the economy could stabilize at 43% in 2026. However, the low survey suggests that rates might not need to increase yet. But given the potential for inflationary pressures in the future and economic uncertainty, it's possible that central banks can lower rates more aggressively or slow down growth further than planned.

(a) The time left until the outcome is known: 0 days as no action is pending.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changes: Inflation could stabilize at 43% in 2026.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: If market participants' confidence drops due to economic uncertainty or if inflation expectations don't improve sufficiently over time, central banks may raise rates more aggressively or slow down growth further than planned.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Central banks can potentially manage current costs and adjust their monetary policy based on improved data showing lower inflationary pressures, possibly leading to a tighter control rate or slower growth.

### Probability: 43%
