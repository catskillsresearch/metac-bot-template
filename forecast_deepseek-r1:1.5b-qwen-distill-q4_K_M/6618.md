Alright, let me break down how I came up with that answer for your forecast about Starlink and its IPO. First, I read through all the information carefully, focusing on each event and what it suggests. 

So, Starlink is mentioned twice: once when Elon Musk's Starlink goes public in 2030, and again when Russia's Roscosmos plans to launch their own low-orbit satellite network called Sfera by 2035. Both of these involve expanding into the same market but from different angles. 

I also see that Starlink has a strong track record with Starlette, offering satellite internet services. The fact that the government in Russia is working on its own project suggests there's potential competition or collaboration that might affect Starlink's success.

Looking at the economic perspective, expanding into low-orbit satellites could bring significant opportunities for businesses both in the US and Russia, which has a growing population in those areas. Plus, it aligns with Trump's policy of supporting massive private-sector growth.

However, I also thought about potential risks like resistance from existing competitors or government concerns about switching to satellite internet over traditional services. These factors could weigh against Starlink's success but are still speculative given the overall context of the timeline and resources involved.

In summary, while there are several positive signs pointing towards Starlink's success, the combination of potential competition, economic opportunities, and the presence of multiple initiatives in tech and business adds some uncertainty. However, I lean toward a high probability that Starlink remains an independent entity under SpaceX.

Probability: 85%

**Status quo outcome if nothing changed:** Starlink continues to operate with SpaceX as an independent entity, aiming to reach space by 2035.

**No outcome scenario:** If the EU or China develop their own satellite internet projects before Starlink is launched, it could result in competition from their new initiatives competing with Starlink's services globally.

**Yes outcome scenario:** Starlink's success and expansion under SpaceX as an independent entity are expected due to its proven track record, cost-effectiveness, and ability to scale operations. The EU's potential competitor may take time to enter the market, but Starlink is unlikely to be surpassed by their efforts unless there is a significant shift in technology adoption or partnerships emerge.

Overall, while there are several factors suggesting Starlink could succeed, these include its proven track record, economic opportunities, and multiple initiatives. However, the presence of potential competition from other players adds some uncertainty. Based on that context, I think the probability is high that Starlink remains independent under SpaceX.
