Alright, so I need to figure out how likely Bitcoin will be stuck below $90,000 today based on the information given. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at all the data points provided. They mention that the price of Bitcoin fell below $90,000 for the first time since January 13, 2024. That's an important starting point because it sets the baseline for what we're looking at today.

The latest information from Binance showed that on March 10 and March 11, the price had fallen below $80,000. So, by those dates, Bitcoin was already below $90,000. That means today is within a few days after that, suggesting some stability in the market.

The article also mentions that even though there are factors like ETF outflows and major exchanges going down, the price hasn't yet broken free from the downward trend since January 13. This implies that while there are some external pressures, the overall market is still showing signs of weakness.

Now, considering the last part of the message, it notes that analysts predict Bitcoin will stay above $93,700 to avoid further drops. So, even if it does break below $90,000 today, they expect it to bounce back up.

Summarizing:
(a) There's about 80% time left for changes.
(b) No change is expected; it remains below $90,000.
(c) A scenario where market sentiment weakens but continues to show signs of stability could result in a No outcome.
(d) A scenario where the weakest signals are amplified by external factors leading to a break through would lead to a Yes.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards a 65% chance (Yes), considering both the recent weakness and analysts' outlook for future strength despite today's potential break below $90,000.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Data**: Bitcoin's price has fallen below $80,000 in March, indicating ongoing weakness despite external factors like ETF outflows and major exchanges affecting Binance and Neobank.

2. **Time Left to Change**: The time frame shows that prices were already below $90,000, meaning today is within a few days post that point, suggesting some stability in the market.

3. **External Factors**: External pressures from ETF outflows and major exchanges are slowing the decline but don't prevent Bitcoin from breaking through.

4. **Analyst's Outlook**: They predict Bitcoin will rise above $93,700 to avoid further losses, indicating bullish sentiment despite the recent weakness.

5. **Conclusion**: While there are signs of weakness, analysts expect strength in the future, giving Bitcoin a Yes outcome despite today's potential break below $90,000.
