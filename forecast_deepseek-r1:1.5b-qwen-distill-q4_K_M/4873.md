Okay, so based on all this information about OpenAI and their plans for AI development, I think they have a good chance of becoming an AGI by 2030. They've already established themselves as a major player in AI research and have solid financials with significant investments in data centers and collaboration with other vendors. Their projections towards future goals show confidence in their ability to scale up production and achieve the target of being an AGI.
