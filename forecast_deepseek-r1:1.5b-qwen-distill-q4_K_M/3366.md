Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to forecast the space market's value from 2024 to 2030 based on the provided data. There are several reports and sources offering different forecasts for the space market. Let me start by looking at all the given information.

First, there are several reports and sources offering different forecasts for the space market:

1. **Space Exploration Report**: This mentions a CAGR of 96%, which is very optimistic.
2. **SNS Insider Report**: Also states an 80% CAGR, but doesn't specify if it's 80% or higher.
3. **Space Propulsion Market Report**: Suggests around 12% growth, which is a bit more realistic than others.
4. **Space Stargate Report**: Offers a growth of 75-95%, which gives a wider range but still not the most optimistic.
5. **Medium Article**: Talks about Citi's estimation reaching $1.8 trillion by 2035, implying it will grow faster than other reports.

Now, considering all these points, I need to determine what the expert consensus would be. The SNS Insider Report mentions a higher CAGR of 80%, and the Space Propulsion Report has a specific range. However, some sources like the Medium article suggest even higher growth towards $1.8 trillion by 2035, which might mean that by 2030 it's somewhere between current levels (let's say $14).

Given these considerations, the expert consensus might average somewhere between 14 and 15, but given that some are more optimistic, I'm leaning towards a higher number. The SNS report's 80% CAGR with $14 seems plausible as an average.

For the current trend if continued, it would follow similar growth at 96%. If no changes are made, it stays flat at current levels, so still $12-15. If nothing continues its trend, it remains unchanged.

An unexpected low outcome might come if there's a sudden event causing rapid collapse, but that seems unlikely given the positive growth indicators from other reports. An unexpected high scenario could be increased funding for space projects or government incentives, which would push the value higher than current levels.

I should structure this into percentile answers as specified, covering 10%, 20%, etc., up to 90%. Each answer will represent an expert consensus, medium, and beyond. I need to ensure each line starts with "Percentile" and contains the appropriate numerical value in billions of dollars without any currency symbols, commas, or spelled-out numbers.
