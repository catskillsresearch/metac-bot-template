### Final Consistent Rationale

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 0, indicating that the question is currently being asked. The status quo outcome if nothing changes is false, suggesting that the current situation is not stable and could evolve. The outcome if the current trend continued is also false, implying that the current trajectory is not leading to a definitive answer. The expectations of experts and markets are false, indicating that there is no consensus or clear prediction from these sources. 

An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome is a significant international agreement leading to a rapid reduction in nuclear arsenals and the elimination of nuclear weapons. This scenario is highly unlikely but possible. An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome is a major geopolitical conflict escalating into a nuclear war, leading to a significant increase in nuclear arsenals. This scenario is also highly unlikely but possible.

Given the current lack of consensus and the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, the final prediction is that the probability of at least one offensive detonation of nuclear weapons by 2050 is very low, with a percentile of 10 at 0.0.
