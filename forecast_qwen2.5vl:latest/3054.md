Rationale:
The forecasts suggest that the average American employee will likely work around 34.3 hours per week in 2030, which is the status quo and the outcome if the current trend continues. However, there is a possibility of both a low and high outcome. The low outcome could be as low as 30 hours per week if the government implements policies such as a universal basic income or a shorter workweek. Conversely, the high outcome could be as high as 40 hours per week if the government and employers successfully implement measures to increase productivity and efficiency, leading to a reduction in the number of hours needed to complete work. The majority of the forecasts predict a range of 30 to 40 hours per week, with the most likely outcome being 34.3 hours per week.
