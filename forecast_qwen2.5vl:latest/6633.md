### Final Consistent Rationale

The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 0 years, as all forecasts indicate that the status quo of not finding alien life will continue if no significant breakthroughs occur. The status quo outcome if nothing changed is true, and the outcome if the current trend continued is also true. The expectations of experts and markets are aligned with the status quo. An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome is the absence of significant breakthroughs in space exploration or alien life detection, leading to the status quo of not finding alien life. An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome is the discovery of alien life, which could lead to a significant change in the status quo. The final prediction is that humanity's descendants will meet grabby aliens in 0 years with a probability of 100% at the 80th percentile and 90th percentile, indicating a high likelihood of this event occurring within the next 0 years.
