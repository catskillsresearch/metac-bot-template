Based on the combined analysis of all rationales provided, here is my forecast with final probability assessment:

(a) Time left until outcome known:
Approximately 9 months remain before comprehensive economic and demographic data becomes available for accurate long-term projections.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed (as of June 18, 2025):
- Based on current data, the US economy is projected to grow at approximately 1.6% annually through 2055
- The federal debt-to-GDP ratio would stabilize around 107%

(c) Current trend continuation:
- If current economic policies and demographic trends continue, there's a high probability of sustained slower growth
- The combination of aging population, declining birth rates, and increasing debt will likely constrain economic expansion

(d) Expert market consensus:
- Economists and markets generally expect 1.5-2% average annual growth through the next decade
- Most projections assume current policy paths but acknowledge significant risks from fiscal decisions and demographic changes

(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario:
- A severe recession due to unforeseen global financial shocks could trigger widespread austerity measures
- Sudden, strict immigration restrictions might further depress population and workforce growth
- These combined factors could push annual growth below 1% for extended periods

(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario:
- Breakthrough technologies in renewable energy or biotech could accelerate economic productivity
- A sudden, large-scale shift toward pro-growth policies could boost innovation and infrastructure investment
- These developments might help offset demographic headwinds, potentially doubling expected growth rates
