Based on the provided rationales, here is a new consistent rationale for forecasting average American employee working hours per week in 2030:

(a) Time left until outcome known:
- Approximately 10 years remain before June 18, 2025.
- This timeframe allows for significant changes in labor markets, technology adoption, and economic conditions that will impact working hour trends.

(b) Status quo outcome if nothing changed:
- Current average weekly working hours in the United States is approximately 34.3 hours per week, based on recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(c) Expected outcome under continued current trend:
- Without significant policy changes or technological disruptions, working hours are likely to continue increasing at a rate of 1-2% annually due to economic growth and labor market pressures.
- This could lead to an expected baseline increase of approximately 2.5-3.0 hours per week within the next decade.

(d) Expert market consensus:
- Economic experts generally project increases in working hours due to anticipated labor shortages in various sectors, particularly in technology and healthcare industries.
- However, there is also growing recognition among labor analysts and social scientists about the potential negative health impacts of extended workweeks on productivity and worker satisfaction.

(e) Unexpected scenario leading to low outcome:
- A major technological breakthrough in automation could lead to significant workforce reductions across multiple industries, potentially causing a temporary decrease in average working hours as companies restructure their operations.
- Environmental regulations or policy changes favoring sustainable development could also impact traditional working hour patterns by incentivizing remote work and flexible scheduling.

(f) Unexpected scenario leading to high outcome:
- Sustained economic growth coupled with favorable demographic trends (such as increased immigration or improved birth rates) could increase the demand for workers across various sectors.
- This could lead to higher average working hours per week, particularly in knowledge-intensive industries where productivity gains are more significant than in manufacturing.

Final Probability Distribution:

Percentile 10: 33.3
Percentile 20: 34.0
Percentile 40: 35.5
Percentile 60: 37.0
Percentile 80: 38.5
Percentile 90: 40.0

This forecast suggests a moderate increase in average working hours, with significant uncertainty due to potential technological disruptions and economic changes. The probability distribution shows that while there is some risk of lower outcomes (below current averages), the most likely scenario points toward increased working hours, particularly if favorable economic conditions persist into the next decade.
