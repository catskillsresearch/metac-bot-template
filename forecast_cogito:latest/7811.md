Here's a synthesized rationale based on the given forecasts:

The question asks how many nuclear weapons will be detonated offensively by 2050, assuming at least one such event occurs. The forecast considers multiple scenarios over this timeframe.

Key considerations include:
- Current global stockpile of approximately 12,000 nuclear warheads
- Expected increases due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and military buildups
- Potential proliferation from new nuclear states (particularly North Korea)
- Possible acceleration in stockpile growth by mid-to-late 2030s
- Impact of international cooperation or sudden disruptions on nuclear arsenals

The forecast anticipates a range of outcomes based on these factors, considering both status quo scenarios and potential shifts in global power dynamics.

Final Prediction:
Percentile 10: 8,500
Percentile 20: 9,750
Percentile 40: 11,250
Percentile 60: 12,500
Percentile 80: 14,000
Percentile 90: 16,000

This prediction reflects the complex interplay of factors influencing nuclear arsenal growth through 2050, while acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in such long-term forecasts.
